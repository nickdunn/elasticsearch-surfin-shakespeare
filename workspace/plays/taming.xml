<STAGEDIR>Enter Hostess and SLY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll pheeze you, in faith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A pair of stocks, you rogue!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in</LINE>
<LINE>the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold</LINE>
<LINE>bed, and warm thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know my remedy; I must go fetch the</LINE>
<LINE>third--borough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him</LINE>
<LINE>by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,</LINE>
<LINE>and kindly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Falls asleep</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:</LINE>
<LINE>Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;</LINE>
<LINE>And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.</LINE>
<LINE>Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good</LINE>
<LINE>At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?</LINE>
<LINE>I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Huntsman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>He cried upon it at the merest loss</LINE>
<LINE>And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:</LINE>
<LINE>Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,</LINE>
<LINE>I would esteem him worth a dozen such.</LINE>
<LINE>But sup them well and look unto them all:</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow I intend to hunt again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Huntsman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Huntsman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,</LINE>
<LINE>This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!</LINE>
<LINE>Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!</LINE>
<LINE>Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.</LINE>
<LINE>What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,</LINE>
<LINE>Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,</LINE>
<LINE>A most delicious banquet by his bed,</LINE>
<LINE>And brave attendants near him when he wakes,</LINE>
<LINE>Would not the beggar then forget himself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Huntsman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Huntsman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It would seem strange unto him when he waked.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.</LINE>
<LINE>Then take him up and manage well the jest:</LINE>
<LINE>Carry him gently to my fairest chamber</LINE>
<LINE>And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:</LINE>
<LINE>Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters</LINE>
<LINE>And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:</LINE>
<LINE>Procure me music ready when he wakes,</LINE>
<LINE>To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;</LINE>
<LINE>And if he chance to speak, be ready straight</LINE>
<LINE>And with a low submissive reverence</LINE>
<LINE>Say 'What is it your honour will command?'</LINE>
<LINE>Let one attend him with a silver basin</LINE>
<LINE>Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,</LINE>
<LINE>Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,</LINE>
<LINE>And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'</LINE>
<LINE>Some one be ready with a costly suit</LINE>
<LINE>And ask him what apparel he will wear;</LINE>
<LINE>Another tell him of his hounds and horse,</LINE>
<LINE>And that his lady mourns at his disease:</LINE>
<LINE>Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;</LINE>
<LINE>And when he says he is, say that he dreams,</LINE>
<LINE>For he is nothing but a mighty lord.</LINE>
<LINE>This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:</LINE>
<LINE>It will be pastime passing excellent,</LINE>
<LINE>If it be husbanded with modesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Huntsman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,</LINE>
<LINE>As he shall think by our true diligence</LINE>
<LINE>He is no less than what we say he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take him up gently and to bed with him;</LINE>
<LINE>And each one to his office when he wakes.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Servingman</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Belike, some noble gentleman that means,</LINE>
<LINE>Travelling some journey, to repose him here.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter Servingman</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now! who is it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An't please your honour, players</LINE>
<LINE>That offer service to your lordship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bid them come near.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Players</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, fellows, you are welcome.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Players</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We thank your honour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you intend to stay with me tonight?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>A Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please your lordship to accept our duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With all my heart. This fellow I remember,</LINE>
<LINE>Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:</LINE>
<LINE>I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part</LINE>
<LINE>Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>A Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, you are come to me in a happy time;</LINE>
<LINE>The rather for I have some sport in hand</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein your cunning can assist me much.</LINE>
<LINE>There is a lord will hear you play to-night:</LINE>
<LINE>But I am doubtful of your modesties;</LINE>
<LINE>Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--</LINE>
<LINE>For yet his honour never heard a play--</LINE>
<LINE>You break into some merry passion</LINE>
<LINE>And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,</LINE>
<LINE>If you should smile he grows impatient.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>A Player</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,</LINE>
<LINE>Were he the veriest antic in the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,</LINE>
<LINE>And give them friendly welcome every one:</LINE>
<LINE>Let them want nothing that my house affords.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit one with the Players</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,</LINE>
<LINE>And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:</LINE>
<LINE>That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;</LINE>
<LINE>And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him from me, as he will win my love,</LINE>
<LINE>He bear himself with honourable action,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as he hath observed in noble ladies</LINE>
<LINE>Unto their lords, by them accomplished:</LINE>
<LINE>Such duty to the drunkard let him do</LINE>
<LINE>With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>And say 'What is't your honour will command,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein your lady and your humble wife</LINE>
<LINE>May show her duty and make known her love?'</LINE>
<LINE>And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,</LINE>
<LINE>And with declining head into his bosom,</LINE>
<LINE>Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd</LINE>
<LINE>To see her noble lord restored to health,</LINE>
<LINE>Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him</LINE>
<LINE>No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:</LINE>
<LINE>And if the boy have not a woman's gift</LINE>
<LINE>To rain a shower of commanded tears,</LINE>
<LINE>An onion will do well for such a shift,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in a napkin being close convey'd</LINE>
<LINE>Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.</LINE>
<LINE>See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:</LINE>
<LINE>Anon I'll give thee more instructions.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit a Servingman</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I know the boy will well usurp the grace,</LINE>
<LINE>Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:</LINE>
<LINE>I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,</LINE>
<LINE>And how my men will stay themselves from laughter</LINE>
<LINE>When they do homage to this simple peasant.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence</LINE>
<LINE>May well abate the over-merry spleen</LINE>
<LINE>Which otherwise would grow into extremes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  A bedchamber in the Lord's house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter aloft SLY, with Attendants; some with apparel,
others with basin and ewer and appurtenances; and Lord</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For God's sake, a pot of small ale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What raiment will your honour wear to-day?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor</LINE>
<LINE>'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if</LINE>
<LINE>you give me any conserves, give me conserves of</LINE>
<LINE>beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I</LINE>
<LINE>have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings</LINE>
<LINE>than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,</LINE>
<LINE>sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my</LINE>
<LINE>toes look through the over-leather.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!</LINE>
<LINE>O, that a mighty man of such descent,</LINE>
<LINE>Of such possessions and so high esteem,</LINE>
<LINE>Should be infused with so foul a spirit!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher</LINE>
<LINE>Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a</LINE>
<LINE>pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a</LINE>
<LINE>bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?</LINE>
<LINE>Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if</LINE>
<LINE>she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence</LINE>
<LINE>on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the</LINE>
<LINE>lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not</LINE>
<LINE>bestraught: here's--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, this is it that makes your servants droop!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,</LINE>
<LINE>As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.</LINE>
<LINE>O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment</LINE>
<LINE>And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.</LINE>
<LINE>Look how thy servants do attend on thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Each in his office ready at thy beck.</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Music</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And twenty caged nightingales do sing:</LINE>
<LINE>Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch</LINE>
<LINE>Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed</LINE>
<LINE>On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.</LINE>
<LINE>Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:</LINE>
<LINE>Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.</LINE>
<LINE>Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar</LINE>
<LINE>Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?</LINE>
<LINE>Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them</LINE>
<LINE>And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift</LINE>
<LINE>As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight</LINE>
<LINE>Adonis painted by a running brook,</LINE>
<LINE>And Cytherea all in sedges hid,</LINE>
<LINE>Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,</LINE>
<LINE>Even as the waving sedges play with wind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,</LINE>
<LINE>And how she was beguiled and surprised,</LINE>
<LINE>As lively painted as the deed was done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,</LINE>
<LINE>Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,</LINE>
<LINE>And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,</LINE>
<LINE>So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Lord</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou hast a lady far more beautiful</LINE>
<LINE>Than any woman in this waning age.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And till the tears that she hath shed for thee</LINE>
<LINE>Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,</LINE>
<LINE>She was the fairest creature in the world;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet she is inferior to none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?</LINE>
<LINE>Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?</LINE>
<LINE>I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;</LINE>
<LINE>I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my life, I am a lord indeed</LINE>
<LINE>And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;</LINE>
<LINE>And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?</LINE>
<LINE>O, how we joy to see your wit restored!</LINE>
<LINE>O, that once more you knew but what you are!</LINE>
<LINE>These fifteen years you have been in a dream;</LINE>
<LINE>Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.</LINE>
<LINE>But did I never speak of all that time?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:</LINE>
<LINE>For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;</LINE>
<LINE>And rail upon the hostess of the house;</LINE>
<LINE>And say you would present her at the leet,</LINE>
<LINE>Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:</LINE>
<LINE>Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, the woman's maid of the house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Third Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,</LINE>
<LINE>As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece</LINE>
<LINE>And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell</LINE>
<LINE>And twenty more such names and men as these</LINE>
<LINE>Which never were nor no man ever saw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Page</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,</LINE>
<LINE>Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, undress you and come now to bed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Page</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you</LINE>
<LINE>To pardon me yet for a night or two,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if not so, until the sun be set:</LINE>
<LINE>For your physicians have expressly charged,</LINE>
<LINE>In peril to incur your former malady,</LINE>
<LINE>That I should yet absent me from your bed:</LINE>
<LINE>I hope this reason stands for my excuse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, it stands so that I may hardly</LINE>
<LINE>tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into</LINE>
<LINE>my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in</LINE>
<LINE>despite of the flesh and the blood.</LINE>

<LINE>Your honour's players, heating your amendment,</LINE>

<LINE>For so your doctors hold it very meet,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore they thought it good you hear a play</LINE>
<LINE>And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,</LINE>
<LINE>Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.</LINE>

<LINE>Tranio, since for the great desire I had</LINE>
<LINE>To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,</LINE>
<LINE>I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,</LINE>
<LINE>The pleasant garden of great Italy;</LINE>
<LINE>And by my father's love and leave am arm'd</LINE>
<LINE>With his good will and thy good company,</LINE>
<LINE>My trusty servant, well approved in all,</LINE>
<LINE>Here let us breathe and haply institute</LINE>

<LINE>Vincetino come of Bentivolii.</LINE>
<LINE>Vincetino's son brought up in Florence</LINE>
<LINE>It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,</LINE>
<LINE>To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue and that part of philosophy</LINE>
<LINE>Will I apply that treats of happiness</LINE>
<LINE>By virtue specially to be achieved.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left</LINE>
<LINE>And am to Padua come, as he that leaves</LINE>
<LINE>A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep</LINE>
<LINE>And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,</LINE>
<LINE>I am in all affected as yourself;</LINE>
<LINE>Glad that you thus continue your resolve</LINE>
<LINE>To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.</LINE>
<LINE>Only, good master, while we do admire</LINE>
<LINE>This virtue and this moral discipline,</LINE>
<LINE>Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;</LINE>
<LINE>Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques</LINE>
<LINE>As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:</LINE>
<LINE>Balk logic with acquaintance that you have</LINE>
<LINE>And practise rhetoric in your common talk;</LINE>
<LINE>Music and poesy use to quicken you;</LINE>
<LINE>The mathematics and the metaphysics,</LINE>
<LINE>Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;</LINE>
<LINE>No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:</LINE>
<LINE>In brief, sir, study what you most affect.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.</LINE>
<LINE>If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,</LINE>
<LINE>We could at once put us in readiness,</LINE>
<LINE>And take a lodging fit to entertain</LINE>
<LINE>Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.</LINE>
<LINE>But stay a while: what company is this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, some show to welcome us to town.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and
HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, importune me no farther,</LINE>
<LINE>For how I firmly am resolved you know;</LINE>
<LINE>That is, not bestow my youngest daughter</LINE>
<LINE>Before I have a husband for the elder:</LINE>
<LINE>If either of you both love Katharina,</LINE>
<LINE>Because I know you well and love you well,</LINE>
<LINE>Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.</LINE>
<LINE>There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, sir, is it your will</LINE>
<LINE>To make a stale of me amongst these mates?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:</LINE>
<LINE>I wis it is not half way to her heart;</LINE>
<LINE>But if it were, doubt not her care should be</LINE>
<LINE>To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool</LINE>
<LINE>And paint your face and use you like a fool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And me too, good Lord!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:</LINE>
<LINE>That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But in the other's silence do I see</LINE>
<LINE>Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.</LINE>
<LINE>Peace, Tranio!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, that I may soon make good</LINE>
<LINE>What I have said, Bianca, get you in:</LINE>
<LINE>And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,</LINE>
<LINE>For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A pretty peat! it is best</LINE>
<LINE>Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sister, content you in my discontent.</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:</LINE>
<LINE>My books and instruments shall be my company,</LINE>
<LINE>On them to took and practise by myself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?</LINE>
<LINE>Sorry am I that our good will effects</LINE>
<LINE>Bianca's grief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why will you mew her up,</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>And make her bear the penance of her tongue?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:</LINE>
<LINE>Go in, Bianca:</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit BIANCA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And for I know she taketh most delight</LINE>
<LINE>In music, instruments and poetry,</LINE>
<LINE>Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,</LINE>
<LINE>Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,</LINE>
<LINE>Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,</LINE>
<LINE>Prefer them hither; for to cunning men</LINE>
<LINE>I will be very kind, and liberal</LINE>
<LINE>To mine own children in good bringing up:</LINE>
<LINE>And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;</LINE>
<LINE>For I have more to commune with Bianca.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,</LINE>
<LINE>shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I</LINE>
<LINE>knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so</LINE>
<LINE>good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not</LINE>
<LINE>so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails</LINE>
<LINE>together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on</LINE>
<LINE>both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my</LINE>
<LINE>sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit</LINE>
<LINE>man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will</LINE>
<LINE>wish him to her father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.</LINE>
<LINE>Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked</LINE>
<LINE>parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,</LINE>
<LINE>that we may yet again have access to our fair</LINE>
<LINE>mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to</LINE>
<LINE>labour and effect one thing specially.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's that, I pray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A husband! a devil.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say, a husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though</LINE>
<LINE>her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool</LINE>
<LINE>to be married to hell?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine</LINE>
<LINE>to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good</LINE>
<LINE>fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,</LINE>
<LINE>would take her with all faults, and money enough.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with</LINE>
<LINE>this condition, to be whipped at the high cross</LINE>
<LINE>every morning.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten</LINE>
<LINE>apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us</LINE>
<LINE>friends, it shall be so far forth friendly</LINE>
<LINE>maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter</LINE>
<LINE>to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,</LINE>
<LINE>and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man</LINE>
<LINE>be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.</LINE>
<LINE>How say you, Signior Gremio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am agreed; and would I had given him the best</LINE>
<LINE>horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would</LINE>
<LINE>thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the</LINE>
<LINE>house of her! Come on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible</LINE>
<LINE>That love should of a sudden take such hold?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Tranio, till I found it to be true,</LINE>
<LINE>I never thought it possible or likely;</LINE>
<LINE>But see, while idly I stood looking on,</LINE>
<LINE>I found the effect of love in idleness:</LINE>
<LINE>And now in plainness do confess to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>That art to me as secret and as dear</LINE>
<LINE>As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,</LINE>
<LINE>Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,</LINE>
<LINE>If I achieve not this young modest girl.</LINE>
<LINE>Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;</LINE>
<LINE>Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, it is no time to chide you now;</LINE>
<LINE>Affection is not rated from the heart:</LINE>
<LINE>If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,</LINE>
<LINE>'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:</LINE>
<LINE>The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,</LINE>
<LINE>Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,</LINE>
<LINE>Such as the daughter of Agenor had,</LINE>
<LINE>That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.</LINE>
<LINE>When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister</LINE>
<LINE>Began to scold and raise up such a storm</LINE>
<LINE>That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move</LINE>
<LINE>And with her breath she did perfume the air:</LINE>
<LINE>Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.</LINE>
<LINE>I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,</LINE>
<LINE>Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:</LINE>
<LINE>Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd</LINE>
<LINE>That till the father rid his hands of her,</LINE>
<LINE>Master, your love must live a maid at home;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,</LINE>
<LINE>Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!</LINE>
<LINE>But art thou not advised, he took some care</LINE>
<LINE>To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have it, Tranio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, for my hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Both our inventions meet and jump in one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me thine first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You will be schoolmaster</LINE>
<LINE>And undertake the teaching of the maid:</LINE>
<LINE>That's your device.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is: may it be done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not possible; for who shall bear your part,</LINE>
<LINE>And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,</LINE>
<LINE>Visit his countrymen and banquet them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Basta; content thee, for I have it full.</LINE>
<LINE>We have not yet been seen in any house,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces</LINE>
<LINE>For man or master; then it follows thus;</LINE>
<LINE>Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep house and port and servants as I should:</LINE>
<LINE>I will some other be, some Florentine,</LINE>
<LINE>Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once</LINE>
<LINE>Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:</LINE>
<LINE>When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;</LINE>
<LINE>But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So had you need.</LINE>
<LINE>In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,</LINE>
<LINE>And I am tied to be obedient;</LINE>
<LINE>For so your father charged me at our parting,</LINE>
<LINE>'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,</LINE>
<LINE>Although I think 'twas in another sense;</LINE>
<LINE>I am content to be Lucentio,</LINE>
<LINE>Because so well I love Lucentio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:</LINE>
<LINE>And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid</LINE>
<LINE>Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes the rogue.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BIONDELLO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sirrah, where have you been?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?</LINE>
<LINE>Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or</LINE>
<LINE>you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore frame your manners to the time.</LINE>
<LINE>Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,</LINE>
<LINE>Puts my apparel and my countenance on,</LINE>
<LINE>And I for my escape have put on his;</LINE>
<LINE>For in a quarrel since I came ashore</LINE>
<LINE>I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:</LINE>
<LINE>Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,</LINE>
<LINE>While I make way from hence to save my life:</LINE>
<LINE>You understand me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I, sir! ne'er a whit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:</LINE>
<LINE>Tranio is changed into Lucentio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The better for him: would I were so too!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,</LINE>
<LINE>That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.</LINE>
<LINE>But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise</LINE>
<LINE>You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:</LINE>
<LINE>When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;</LINE>
<LINE>But in all places else your master Lucentio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that</LINE>
<LINE>thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if</LINE>
<LINE>thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good</LINE>
<LINE>and weighty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>The presenters above speak</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:</LINE>
<LINE>comes there any more of it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Page</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, 'tis but begun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SLY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:</LINE>
<LINE>would 'twere done!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Verona, for a while I take my leave,</LINE>
<LINE>To see my friends in Padua, but of all</LINE>
<LINE>My best beloved and approved friend,</LINE>
<LINE>Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.</LINE>
<LINE>Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has</LINE>
<LINE>rebused your worship?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that</LINE>
<LINE>I should knock you here, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villain, I say, knock me at this gate</LINE>
<LINE>And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock</LINE>
<LINE>you first,</LINE>
<LINE>And then I know after who comes by the worst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will it not be?</LINE>
<LINE>Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>He wrings him by the ears</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Help, masters, help! my master is mad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter HORTENSIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!</LINE>
<LINE>and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?</LINE>
<LINE>'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor</LINE>
<LINE>mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound</LINE>
<LINE>this quarrel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.</LINE>
<LINE>if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his</LINE>
<LINE>service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap</LINE>
<LINE>him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to</LINE>
<LINE>use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,</LINE>
<LINE>two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had</LINE>
<LINE>well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,</LINE>
<LINE>I bade the rascal knock upon your gate</LINE>
<LINE>And could not get him for my heart to do it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these</LINE>
<LINE>words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,</LINE>
<LINE>knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you</LINE>
<LINE>now with, 'knocking at the gate'?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:</LINE>
<LINE>Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,</LINE>
<LINE>Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.</LINE>
<LINE>And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale</LINE>
<LINE>Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such wind as scatters young men through the world,</LINE>
<LINE>To seek their fortunes farther than at home</LINE>
<LINE>Where small experience grows. But in a few,</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:</LINE>
<LINE>Antonio, my father, is deceased;</LINE>
<LINE>And I have thrust myself into this maze,</LINE>
<LINE>Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:</LINE>
<LINE>Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,</LINE>
<LINE>And so am come abroad to see the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee</LINE>
<LINE>And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:</LINE>
<LINE>And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich</LINE>
<LINE>And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll not wish thee to her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we</LINE>
<LINE>Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know</LINE>
<LINE>One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,</LINE>
<LINE>As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,</LINE>
<LINE>Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,</LINE>
<LINE>As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd</LINE>
<LINE>As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,</LINE>
<LINE>She moves me not, or not removes, at least,</LINE>
<LINE>Affection's edge in me, were she as rough</LINE>
<LINE>As are the swelling Adriatic seas:</LINE>
<LINE>I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;</LINE>
<LINE>If wealthily, then happily in Padua.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his</LINE>
<LINE>mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to</LINE>
<LINE>a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er</LINE>
<LINE>a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases</LINE>
<LINE>as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,</LINE>
<LINE>so money comes withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,</LINE>
<LINE>I will continue that I broach'd in jest.</LINE>
<LINE>I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife</LINE>
<LINE>With wealth enough and young and beauteous,</LINE>
<LINE>Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:</LINE>
<LINE>Her only fault, and that is faults enough,</LINE>
<LINE>Is that she is intolerable curst</LINE>
<LINE>And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure</LINE>
<LINE>That, were my state far worser than it is,</LINE>
<LINE>I would not wed her for a mine of gold.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;</LINE>
<LINE>For I will board her, though she chide as loud</LINE>
<LINE>As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Her father is Baptista Minola,</LINE>
<LINE>An affable and courteous gentleman:</LINE>
<LINE>Her name is Katharina Minola,</LINE>
<LINE>Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know her father, though I know not her;</LINE>
<LINE>And he knew my deceased father well.</LINE>
<LINE>I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore let me be thus bold with you</LINE>
<LINE>To give you over at this first encounter,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you will accompany me thither.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.</LINE>
<LINE>O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she</LINE>
<LINE>would think scolding would do little good upon him:</LINE>
<LINE>she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:</LINE>
<LINE>why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in</LINE>
<LINE>his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she</LINE>
<LINE>stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in</LINE>
<LINE>her face and so disfigure her with it that she</LINE>
<LINE>shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.</LINE>
<LINE>You know him not, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,</LINE>
<LINE>For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:</LINE>
<LINE>He hath the jewel of my life in hold,</LINE>
<LINE>His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,</LINE>
<LINE>And her withholds from me and other more,</LINE>
<LINE>Suitors to her and rivals in my love,</LINE>
<LINE>Supposing it a thing impossible,</LINE>
<LINE>For those defects I have before rehearsed,</LINE>
<LINE>That ever Katharina will be woo'd;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,</LINE>
<LINE>That none shall have access unto Bianca</LINE>
<LINE>Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Katharina the curst!</LINE>
<LINE>A title for a maid of all titles the worst.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,</LINE>
<LINE>And offer me disguised in sober robes</LINE>
<LINE>To old Baptista as a schoolmaster</LINE>
<LINE>Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;</LINE>
<LINE>That so I may, by this device, at least</LINE>
<LINE>Have leave and leisure to make love to her</LINE>
<LINE>And unsuspected court her by herself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,</LINE>
<LINE>how the young folks lay their heads together!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.</LINE>
<LINE>Petruchio, stand by a while.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A proper stripling and an amorous!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, very well; I have perused the note.</LINE>
<LINE>Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:</LINE>
<LINE>All books of love, see that at any hand;</LINE>
<LINE>And see you read no other lectures to her:</LINE>
<LINE>You understand me: over and beside</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Baptista's liberality,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,</LINE>
<LINE>And let me have them very well perfumed</LINE>
<LINE>For she is sweeter than perfume itself</LINE>
<LINE>To whom they go to. What will you read to her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you</LINE>
<LINE>As for my patron, stand you so assured,</LINE>
<LINE>As firmly as yourself were still in place:</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, and perhaps with more successful words</LINE>
<LINE>Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O this learning, what a thing it is!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O this woodcock, what an ass it is!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, sirrah!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.</LINE>
<LINE>Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.</LINE>
<LINE>I promised to inquire carefully</LINE>
<LINE>About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:</LINE>
<LINE>And by good fortune I have lighted well</LINE>
<LINE>On this young man, for learning and behavior</LINE>
<LINE>Fit for her turn, well read in poetry</LINE>
<LINE>And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman</LINE>
<LINE>Hath promised me to help me to another,</LINE>
<LINE>A fine musician to instruct our mistress;</LINE>
<LINE>So shall I no whit be behind in duty</LINE>
<LINE>To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And that his bags shall prove.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:</LINE>
<LINE>Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.</LINE>
<LINE>Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon agreement from us to his liking,</LINE>
<LINE>Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So said, so done, is well.</LINE>
<LINE>Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know she is an irksome brawling scold:</LINE>
<LINE>If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:</LINE>
<LINE>My father dead, my fortune lives for me;</LINE>
<LINE>And I do hope good days and long to see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!</LINE>
<LINE>But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:</LINE>
<LINE>You shall have me assisting you in all.</LINE>
<LINE>But will you woo this wild-cat?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will I live?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why came I hither but to that intent?</LINE>
<LINE>Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?</LINE>
<LINE>Have I not in my time heard lions roar?</LINE>
<LINE>Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds</LINE>
<LINE>Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?</LINE>
<LINE>Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,</LINE>
<LINE>And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?</LINE>
<LINE>Have I not in a pitched battle heard</LINE>
<LINE>Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?</LINE>
<LINE>And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>That gives not half so great a blow to hear</LINE>
<LINE>As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?</LINE>
<LINE>Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For he fears none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hortensio, hark:</LINE>
<LINE>This gentleman is happily arrived,</LINE>
<LINE>My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I promised we would be contributors</LINE>
<LINE>And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so we will, provided that he win her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would I were as sure of a good dinner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way</LINE>
<LINE>To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even he, Biondello.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well begun, Tranio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, a word ere you go;</LINE>
<LINE>Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And if I be, sir, is it any offence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; if without more words you will get you hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free</LINE>
<LINE>For me as for you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But so is not she.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For what reason, I beseech you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For this reason, if you'll know,</LINE>
<LINE>That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>Do me this right; hear me with patience.</LINE>
<LINE>Baptista is a noble gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>To whom my father is not all unknown;</LINE>
<LINE>And were his daughter fairer than she is,</LINE>
<LINE>She may more suitors have and me for one.</LINE>
<LINE>Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;</LINE>
<LINE>Then well one more may fair Bianca have:</LINE>
<LINE>And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,</LINE>
<LINE>Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hortensio, to what end are all these words?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,</LINE>
<LINE>Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,</LINE>
<LINE>The one as famous for a scolding tongue</LINE>
<LINE>As is the other for beauteous modesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;</LINE>
<LINE>And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:</LINE>
<LINE>The youngest daughter whom you hearken for</LINE>
<LINE>Her father keeps from all access of suitors,</LINE>
<LINE>And will not promise her to any man</LINE>
<LINE>Until the elder sister first be wed:</LINE>
<LINE>The younger then is free and not before.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If it be so, sir, that you are the man</LINE>
<LINE>Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>And if you break the ice and do this feat,</LINE>
<LINE>Achieve the elder, set the younger free</LINE>
<LINE>For our access, whose hap shall be to have her</LINE>
<LINE>Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;</LINE>
<LINE>And since you do profess to be a suitor,</LINE>
<LINE>You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,</LINE>
<LINE>To whom we all rest generally beholding.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,</LINE>
<LINE>Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,</LINE>
<LINE>And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,</LINE>
<LINE>And do as adversaries do in law,</LINE>
<LINE>Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The motion's good indeed and be it so,</LINE>
<LINE>Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.</LINE>

<LINE>For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are too blunt: go to it orderly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.</LINE>
<LINE>I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,</LINE>
<LINE>Her affability and bashful modesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,</LINE>
<LINE>Am bold to show myself a forward guest</LINE>
<LINE>Within your house, to make mine eye the witness</LINE>
<LINE>Of that report which I so oft have heard.</LINE>
<LINE>And, for an entrance to my entertainment,</LINE>
<LINE>I do present you with a man of mine,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Presenting HORTENSIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Cunning in music and the mathematics,</LINE>
<LINE>To instruct her fully in those sciences,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see you do not mean to part with her,</LINE>

<LINE>O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your</LINE>
<LINE>wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am</LINE>
<LINE>sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,</LINE>
<LINE>that have been more kindly beholding to you than</LINE>
<LINE>any, freely give unto you this young scholar,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Presenting LUCENTIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning</LINE>
<LINE>in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other</LINE>
<LINE>in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,</LINE>
<LINE>accept his service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.</LINE>
<LINE>Welcome, good Cambio.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To TRANIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:</LINE>
<LINE>may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,</LINE>
<LINE>That, being a stranger in this city here,</LINE>
<LINE>Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.</LINE>
<LINE>Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,</LINE>
<LINE>In the preferment of the eldest sister.</LINE>
<LINE>This liberty is all that I request,</LINE>
<LINE>That, upon knowledge of my parentage,</LINE>
<LINE>I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo</LINE>
<LINE>And free access and favour as the rest:</LINE>
<LINE>And, toward the education of your daughters,</LINE>
<LINE>I here bestow a simple instrument,</LINE>

<LINE>If you accept them, then their worth is great.</LINE>

<LINE>You shall go see your pupils presently.</LINE>
<LINE>Holla, within!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter a Servant</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sirrah, lead these gentlemen</LINE>
<LINE>To my daughters; and tell them both,</LINE>
<LINE>These are their tutors: bid them use them well.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO,
BIONDELLO following</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>We will go walk a little in the orchard,</LINE>
<LINE>And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,</LINE>
<LINE>And so I pray you all to think yourselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,</LINE>
<LINE>And every day I cannot come to woo.</LINE>
<LINE>You knew my father well, and in him me,</LINE>
<LINE>Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have better'd rather than decreased:</LINE>
<LINE>Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,</LINE>
<LINE>What dowry shall I have with her to wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>After my death the one half of my lands,</LINE>
<LINE>And in possession twenty thousand crowns.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of</LINE>
<LINE>Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,</LINE>
<LINE>In all my lands and leases whatsoever:</LINE>
<LINE>Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,</LINE>
<LINE>That covenants may be kept on either hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,</LINE>
<LINE>That is, her love; for that is all in all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,</LINE>
<LINE>I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;</LINE>
<LINE>And where two raging fires meet together</LINE>
<LINE>They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:</LINE>
<LINE>Though little fire grows great with little wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:</LINE>
<LINE>So I to her and so she yields to me;</LINE>
<LINE>For I am rough and woo not like a babe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!</LINE>
<LINE>But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,</LINE>
<LINE>That shake not, though they blow perpetually.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, will my daughter prove a good musician?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think she'll sooner prove a soldier</LINE>
<LINE>Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.</LINE>
<LINE>I did but tell her she mistook her frets,</LINE>
<LINE>And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;</LINE>
<LINE>When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume</LINE>
<LINE>with them:'</LINE>
<LINE>And, with that word, she struck me on the head,</LINE>
<LINE>And through the instrument my pate made way;</LINE>
<LINE>And there I stood amazed for a while,</LINE>
<LINE>As on a pillory, looking through the lute;</LINE>
<LINE>While she did call me rascal fiddler</LINE>
<LINE>And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,</LINE>
<LINE>As had she studied to misuse me so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;</LINE>
<LINE>I love her ten times more than e'er I did:</LINE>
<LINE>O, how I long to have some chat with her!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:</LINE>
<LINE>Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;</LINE>
<LINE>She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you do.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I will attend her here,</LINE>
<LINE>And woo her with some spirit when she comes.</LINE>
<LINE>Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain</LINE>
<LINE>She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:</LINE>
<LINE>Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear</LINE>
<LINE>As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:</LINE>
<LINE>Say she be mute and will not speak a word;</LINE>
<LINE>Then I'll commend her volubility,</LINE>
<LINE>And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:</LINE>
<LINE>If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,</LINE>
<LINE>As though she bid me stay by her a week:</LINE>
<LINE>If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day</LINE>
<LINE>When I shall ask the banns and when be married.</LINE>
<LINE>But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter KATHARINA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:</LINE>
<LINE>They call me Katharina that do talk of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,</LINE>
<LINE>And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;</LINE>
<LINE>But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom</LINE>
<LINE>Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,</LINE>
<LINE>For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,</LINE>
<LINE>Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;</LINE>
<LINE>Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,</LINE>
<LINE>Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither</LINE>
<LINE>Remove you hence: I knew you at the first</LINE>
<LINE>You were a moveable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what's a moveable?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A join'd-stool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Asses are made to bear, and so are you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Women are made to bear, and so are you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No such jade as you, if me you mean.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;</LINE>
<LINE>For, knowing thee to be but young and light--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too light for such a swain as you to catch;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet as heavy as my weight should be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Should be! should--buzz!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I be waspish, best beware my sting.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My remedy is then, to pluck it out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who knows not where a wasp does</LINE>
<LINE>wear his sting? In his tail.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In his tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whose tongue?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,</LINE>
<LINE>Good Kate; I am a gentleman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That I'll try.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>She strikes him</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So may you lose your arms:</LINE>
<LINE>If you strike me, you are no gentleman;</LINE>
<LINE>And if no gentleman, why then no arms.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is your crest? a coxcomb?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is my fashion, when I see a crab.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There is, there is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then show it me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Had I a glass, I would.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, you mean my face?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well aim'd of such a young one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet you are wither'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis with cares.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I care not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,</LINE>
<LINE>And now I find report a very liar;</LINE>
<LINE>For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,</LINE>
<LINE>But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:</LINE>
<LINE>Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,</LINE>
<LINE>But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,</LINE>
<LINE>With gentle conference, soft and affable.</LINE>
<LINE>Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?</LINE>
<LINE>O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig</LINE>
<LINE>Is straight and slender and as brown in hue</LINE>
<LINE>As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.</LINE>
<LINE>O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did ever Dian so become a grove</LINE>
<LINE>As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?</LINE>
<LINE>O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;</LINE>
<LINE>And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where did you study all this goodly speech?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is extempore, from my mother-wit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A witty mother! witless else her son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I not wise?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes; keep you warm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, setting all this chat aside,</LINE>
<LINE>Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented</LINE>
<LINE>That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;</LINE>
<LINE>And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.</LINE>
<LINE>Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;</LINE>
<LINE>For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou must be married to no man but me;</LINE>
<LINE>For I am he am born to tame you Kate,</LINE>
<LINE>And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate</LINE>
<LINE>Conformable as other household Kates.</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes your father: never make denial;</LINE>
<LINE>I must and will have Katharina to my wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How but well, sir? how but well?</LINE>
<LINE>It were impossible I should speed amiss.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call you me daughter? now, I promise you</LINE>
<LINE>You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,</LINE>
<LINE>To wish me wed to one half lunatic;</LINE>
<LINE>A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,</LINE>
<LINE>That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,</LINE>
<LINE>That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:</LINE>
<LINE>If she be curst, it is for policy,</LINE>
<LINE>For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;</LINE>
<LINE>She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;</LINE>
<LINE>For patience she will prove a second Grissel,</LINE>
<LINE>And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:</LINE>
<LINE>And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,</LINE>
<LINE>That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee</LINE>
<LINE>hang'd first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:</LINE>
<LINE>If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,</LINE>
<LINE>That she shall still be curst in company.</LINE>
<LINE>I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe</LINE>
<LINE>How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!</LINE>
<LINE>She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss</LINE>
<LINE>She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,</LINE>
<LINE>That in a twink she won me to her love.</LINE>
<LINE>O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,</LINE>
<LINE>How tame, when men and women are alone,</LINE>
<LINE>A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,</LINE>
<LINE>To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.</LINE>
<LINE>Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;</LINE>
<LINE>I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not what to say: but give me your hands;</LINE>
<LINE>God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;</LINE>
<LINE>I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:</LINE>
<LINE>We will have rings and things and fine array;</LINE>
<LINE>And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,</LINE>
<LINE>And venture madly on a desperate mart.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:</LINE>
<LINE>'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.</LINE>
<LINE>But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:</LINE>
<LINE>Now is the day we long have looked for:</LINE>
<LINE>I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I am one that love Bianca more</LINE>
<LINE>Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But thine doth fry.</LINE>
<LINE>Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both</LINE>
<LINE>That can assure my daughter greatest dower</LINE>
<LINE>Shall have my Bianca's love.</LINE>
<LINE>Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, as you know, my house within the city</LINE>
<LINE>Is richly furnished with plate and gold;</LINE>
<LINE>Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;</LINE>
<LINE>My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;</LINE>
<LINE>In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;</LINE>
<LINE>In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,</LINE>
<LINE>Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,</LINE>
<LINE>Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,</LINE>
<LINE>Valance of Venice gold in needlework,</LINE>
<LINE>Pewter and brass and all things that belong</LINE>
<LINE>To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm</LINE>
<LINE>I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,</LINE>
<LINE>Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,</LINE>
<LINE>And all things answerable to this portion.</LINE>
<LINE>Myself am struck in years, I must confess;</LINE>
<LINE>And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,</LINE>
<LINE>If whilst I live she will be only mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:</LINE>
<LINE>I am my father's heir and only son:</LINE>
<LINE>If I may have your daughter to my wife,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll leave her houses three or four as good,</LINE>
<LINE>Within rich Pisa walls, as any one</LINE>
<LINE>Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;</LINE>
<LINE>Besides two thousand ducats by the year</LINE>
<LINE>Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.</LINE>
<LINE>What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Two thousand ducats by the year of land!</LINE>
<LINE>My land amounts not to so much in all:</LINE>
<LINE>That she shall have; besides an argosy</LINE>
<LINE>That now is lying in Marseilles' road.</LINE>
<LINE>What, have I choked you with an argosy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less</LINE>
<LINE>Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,</LINE>
<LINE>And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,</LINE>
<LINE>And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;</LINE>
<LINE>And she can have no more than all I have:</LINE>
<LINE>If you like me, she shall have me and mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,</LINE>
<LINE>By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must confess your offer is the best;</LINE>
<LINE>And, let your father make her the assurance,</LINE>
<LINE>She is your own; else, you must pardon me,</LINE>
<LINE>if you should die before him, where's her dower?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And may not young men die, as well as old?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, gentlemen,</LINE>
<LINE>I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know</LINE>
<LINE>My daughter Katharina is to be married:</LINE>
<LINE>Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca</LINE>
<LINE>Be bride to you, if you this assurance;</LINE>
<LINE>If not, Signior Gremio:</LINE>
<LINE>And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Adieu, good neighbour.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit BAPTISTA</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now I fear thee not:</LINE>
<LINE>Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool</LINE>
<LINE>To give thee all, and in his waning age</LINE>
<LINE>Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!</LINE>
<LINE>An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis in my head to do my master good:</LINE>
<LINE>I see no reason but supposed Lucentio</LINE>
<LINE>Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'</LINE>
<LINE>And that's a wonder: fathers commonly</LINE>
<LINE>Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,</LINE>
<LINE>A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:</LINE>
<LINE>Have you so soon forgot the entertainment</LINE>
<LINE>Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, wrangling pedant, this is</LINE>
<LINE>The patroness of heavenly harmony:</LINE>
<LINE>Then give me leave to have prerogative;</LINE>
<LINE>And when in music we have spent an hour,</LINE>
<LINE>Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Preposterous ass, that never read so far</LINE>
<LINE>To know the cause why music was ordain'd!</LINE>
<LINE>Was it not to refresh the mind of man</LINE>
<LINE>After his studies or his usual pain?</LINE>
<LINE>Then give me leave to read philosophy,</LINE>
<LINE>And while I pause, serve in your harmony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,</LINE>
<LINE>To strive for that which resteth in my choice:</LINE>
<LINE>I am no breeching scholar in the schools;</LINE>
<LINE>I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,</LINE>
<LINE>But learn my lessons as I please myself.</LINE>
<LINE>And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:</LINE>
<LINE>Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;</LINE>
<LINE>His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That will be never: tune your instrument.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where left we last?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here, madam:</LINE>
<LINE>'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;</LINE>
<LINE>Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Construe them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am</LINE>
<LINE>Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,</LINE>
<LINE>'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;</LINE>
<LINE>'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes</LINE>
<LINE>a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'</LINE>
<LINE>bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might</LINE>
<LINE>beguile the old pantaloon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, my instrument's in tune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat</LINE>
<LINE>Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I</LINE>
<LINE>trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed</LINE>
<LINE>he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'</LINE>
<LINE>despair not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, 'tis now in tune.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All but the base.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How fiery and forward our pedant is!</LINE>
<LINE>Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:</LINE>
<LINE>Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides</LINE>
<LINE>Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must believe my master; else, I promise you,</LINE>
<LINE>I should be arguing still upon that doubt:</LINE>
<LINE>But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:</LINE>
<LINE>Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,</LINE>
<LINE>That I have been thus pleasant with you both.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You may go walk, and give me leave a while:</LINE>
<LINE>My lessons make no music in three parts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,</LINE>
<LINE>Our fine musician groweth amorous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, before you touch the instrument,</LINE>
<LINE>To learn the order of my fingering,</LINE>
<LINE>I must begin with rudiments of art;</LINE>
<LINE>To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,</LINE>
<LINE>More pleasant, pithy and effectual,</LINE>
<LINE>Than hath been taught by any of my trade:</LINE>
<LINE>And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, I am past my gamut long ago.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>  ''Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,</LINE>
<LINE>'A re,' to Plead Hortensio's passion;</LINE>
<LINE>'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,</LINE>
<LINE>'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:</LINE>
<LINE>'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:</LINE>
<LINE>'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.'</LINE>
<LINE>Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:</LINE>
<LINE>Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,</LINE>
<LINE>To change true rules for old inventions.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter a Servant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress, your father prays you leave your books</LINE>
<LINE>And help to dress your sister's chamber up:</LINE>
<LINE>You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt BIANCA and Servant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I have cause to pry into this pedant:</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks he looks as though he were in love:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble</LINE>
<LINE>To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,</LINE>
<LINE>Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,</LINE>
<LINE>Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA,
LUCENTIO, and others, attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To TRANIO</STAGEDIR>  Signior Lucentio, this is the</LINE>
<LINE>'pointed day.</LINE>
<LINE>That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.</LINE>
<LINE>What will be said? what mockery will it be,</LINE>
<LINE>To want the bridegroom when the priest attends</LINE>
<LINE>To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!</LINE>
<LINE>What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced</LINE>
<LINE>To give my hand opposed against my heart</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;</LINE>
<LINE>Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.</LINE>
<LINE>I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,</LINE>
<LINE>Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:</LINE>
<LINE>And, to be noted for a merry man,</LINE>
<LINE>He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Now must the world point at poor Katharina,</LINE>
<LINE>And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,</LINE>
<LINE>If it would please him come and marry her!'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,</LINE>
<LINE>Whatever fortune stays him from his word:</LINE>
<LINE>Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;</LINE>
<LINE>Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would Katharina had never seen him though!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;</LINE>
<LINE>For such an injury would vex a very saint,</LINE>
<LINE>Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter BIONDELLO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, master! news, old news, and such news as</LINE>
<LINE>you never heard of!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it new and old too? how may that be?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is he come?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, no, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What then?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is coming.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When will he be here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When he stands where I am and sees you there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But say, what to thine old news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old</LINE>
<LINE>jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair</LINE>
<LINE>of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,</LINE>
<LINE>another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the</LINE>
<LINE>town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;</LINE>
<LINE>with two broken points: his horse hipped with an</LINE>
<LINE>old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;</LINE>
<LINE>besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose</LINE>
<LINE>in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected</LINE>
<LINE>with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with</LINE>
<LINE>spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,</LINE>
<LINE>stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the</LINE>
<LINE>bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;</LINE>
<LINE>near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit</LINE>
<LINE>and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being</LINE>
<LINE>restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been</LINE>
<LINE>often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth</LINE>
<LINE>six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,</LINE>
<LINE>which hath two letters for her name fairly set down</LINE>
<LINE>in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who comes with him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned</LINE>
<LINE>like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a</LINE>
<LINE>kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red</LINE>
<LINE>and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty</LINE>
<LINE>fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a</LINE>
<LINE>very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian</LINE>
<LINE>footboy or a gentleman's lackey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, he comes not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Didst thou not say he comes?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who? that Petruchio came?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, that Petruchio came.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that's all one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, by Saint Jamy,</LINE>
<LINE>I hold you a penny,</LINE>
<LINE>A horse and a man</LINE>
<LINE>Is more than one,</LINE>
<LINE>And yet not many.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are welcome, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yet I come not well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yet you halt not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so well apparell'd</LINE>
<LINE>As I wish you were.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were it better, I should rush in thus.</LINE>
<LINE>But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?</LINE>
<LINE>How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:</LINE>
<LINE>And wherefore gaze this goodly company,</LINE>
<LINE>As if they saw some wondrous monument,</LINE>
<LINE>Some comet or unusual prodigy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:</LINE>
<LINE>First were we sad, fearing you would not come;</LINE>
<LINE>Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.</LINE>
<LINE>Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,</LINE>
<LINE>An eye-sore to our solemn festival!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And tells us, what occasion of import</LINE>
<LINE>Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,</LINE>
<LINE>And sent you hither so unlike yourself?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:</LINE>
<LINE>Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,</LINE>
<LINE>Though in some part enforced to digress;</LINE>
<LINE>Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse</LINE>
<LINE>As you shall well be satisfied withal.</LINE>
<LINE>But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:</LINE>
<LINE>The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See not your bride in these unreverent robes:</LINE>
<LINE>Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:</LINE>
<LINE>To me she's married, not unto my clothes:</LINE>
<LINE>Could I repair what she will wear in me,</LINE>
<LINE>As I can change these poor accoutrements,</LINE>
<LINE>'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.</LINE>
<LINE>But what a fool am I to chat with you,</LINE>
<LINE>When I should bid good morrow to my bride,</LINE>
<LINE>And seal the title with a lovely kiss!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath some meaning in his mad attire:</LINE>
<LINE>We will persuade him, be it possible,</LINE>
<LINE>To put on better ere he go to church.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll after him, and see the event of this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But to her love concerneth us to add</LINE>
<LINE>Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,</LINE>
<LINE>As I before unparted to your worship,</LINE>
<LINE>I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,</LINE>
<LINE>It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--</LINE>
<LINE>And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;</LINE>
<LINE>And make assurance here in Padua</LINE>
<LINE>Of greater sums than I have promised.</LINE>
<LINE>So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,</LINE>
<LINE>And marry sweet Bianca with consent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Were it not that my fellow-school-master</LINE>
<LINE>Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,</LINE>
<LINE>'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;</LINE>
<LINE>Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That by degrees we mean to look into,</LINE>
<LINE>And watch our vantage in this business:</LINE>
<LINE>We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,</LINE>
<LINE>The narrow-prying father, Minola,</LINE>
<LINE>The quaint musician, amorous Licio;</LINE>
<LINE>All for my master's sake, Lucentio.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter GREMIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Signior Gremio, came you from the church?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As willingly as e'er I came from school.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,</LINE>
<LINE>A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!</LINE>
<LINE>I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest</LINE>
<LINE>Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,</LINE>
<LINE>'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,</LINE>
<LINE>That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;</LINE>
<LINE>And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,</LINE>
<LINE>The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff</LINE>
<LINE>That down fell priest and book and book and priest:</LINE>
<LINE>'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What said the wench when he rose again?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,</LINE>
<LINE>As if the vicar meant to cozen him.</LINE>
<LINE>But after many ceremonies done,</LINE>
<LINE>He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if</LINE>
<LINE>He had been aboard, carousing to his mates</LINE>
<LINE>After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel</LINE>
<LINE>And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;</LINE>
<LINE>Having no other reason</LINE>
<LINE>But that his beard grew thin and hungerly</LINE>
<LINE>And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.</LINE>
<LINE>This done, he took the bride about the neck</LINE>
<LINE>And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack</LINE>
<LINE>That at the parting all the church did echo:</LINE>
<LINE>And I seeing this came thence for very shame;</LINE>
<LINE>And after me, I know, the rout is coming.</LINE>
<LINE>Such a mad marriage never was before:</LINE>
<LINE>Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.</LINE>

<LINE>Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:</LINE>
<LINE>I know you think to dine with me to-day,</LINE>
<LINE>And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;</LINE>
<LINE>But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,</LINE>

<LINE>Is't possible you will away to-night?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I must away to-day, before night come:</LINE>
<LINE>Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,</LINE>
<LINE>You would entreat me rather go than stay.</LINE>
<LINE>And, honest company, I thank you all,</LINE>
<LINE>That have beheld me give away myself</LINE>
<LINE>To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:</LINE>
<LINE>Dine with my father, drink a health to me;</LINE>
<LINE>For I must hence; and farewell to you all.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter GRUMIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and</LINE>
<LINE>all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever</LINE>
<LINE>man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent</LINE>
<LINE>before to make a fire, and they are coming after to</LINE>
<LINE>warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon</LINE>
<LINE>hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my</LINE>
<LINE>tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my</LINE>
<LINE>belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but</LINE>
<LINE>I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,</LINE>
<LINE>considering the weather, a taller man than I will</LINE>
<LINE>take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter CURTIS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who is that calls so coldly?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide</LINE>
<LINE>from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run</LINE>
<LINE>but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast</LINE>
<LINE>on no water.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou</LINE>
<LINE>knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it</LINE>
<LINE>hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and</LINE>
<LINE>myself, fellow Curtis.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and</LINE>
<LINE>so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a</LINE>
<LINE>fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,</LINE>
<LINE>whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon</LINE>
<LINE>feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and</LINE>
<LINE>therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for</LINE>
<LINE>my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as</LINE>
<LINE>will thaw.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, you are so full of cony-catching!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.</LINE>
<LINE>Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house</LINE>
<LINE>trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the</LINE>
<LINE>serving-men in their new fustian, their white</LINE>
<LINE>stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?</LINE>
<LINE>Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,</LINE>
<LINE>the carpets laid, and every thing in order?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First, know, my horse is tired; my master and</LINE>
<LINE>mistress fallen out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby</LINE>
<LINE>hangs a tale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let's ha't, good Grumio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lend thine ear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Strikes him</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this</LINE>
<LINE>cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech</LINE>
<LINE>listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a</LINE>
<LINE>foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Both of one horse?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's that to thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, a horse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,</LINE>
<LINE>thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she</LINE>
<LINE>under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how</LINE>
<LINE>miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her</LINE>
<LINE>with the horse upon her, how he beat me because</LINE>
<LINE>her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt</LINE>
<LINE>to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,</LINE>
<LINE>that never prayed before, how I cried, how the</LINE>
<LINE>horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I</LINE>
<LINE>lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,</LINE>
<LINE>which now shall die in oblivion and thou return</LINE>
<LINE>unexperienced to thy grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall</LINE>
<LINE>find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?</LINE>
<LINE>Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,</LINE>
<LINE>Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be</LINE>
<LINE>sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their</LINE>
<LINE>garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy</LINE>
<LINE>with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair</LINE>
<LINE>of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their</LINE>
<LINE>hands. Are they all ready?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>

<LINE>countenance my mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, she hath a face of her own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who knows not that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou, it seems, that calls for company to</LINE>
<LINE>countenance her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CURTIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I call them forth to credit her.</LINE>

<LINE>Thus have I politicly begun my reign,</LINE>
<LINE>And 'tis my hope to end successfully.</LINE>
<LINE>My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;</LINE>
<LINE>And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,</LINE>
<LINE>For then she never looks upon her lure.</LINE>
<LINE>Another way I have to man my haggard,</LINE>
<LINE>To make her come and know her keeper's call,</LINE>
<LINE>That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites</LINE>
<LINE>That bate and beat and will not be obedient.</LINE>
<LINE>She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;</LINE>
<LINE>Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;</LINE>
<LINE>As with the meat, some undeserved fault</LINE>
<LINE>I'll find about the making of the bed;</LINE>
<LINE>And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,</LINE>
<LINE>This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, and amid this hurly I intend</LINE>
<LINE>That all is done in reverend care of her;</LINE>
<LINE>And in conclusion she shall watch all night:</LINE>
<LINE>And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl</LINE>
<LINE>And with the clamour keep her still awake.</LINE>
<LINE>This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;</LINE>
<LINE>And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.</LINE>
<LINE>He that knows better how to tame a shrew,</LINE>
<LINE>Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.</LINE>

<LINE>And here I take the unfeigned oath,</LINE>
<LINE>Never to marry with her though she would entreat:</LINE>
<LINE>Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!</LINE>
<LINE>For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,</LINE>
<LINE>I will be married to a wealthy widow,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me</LINE>
<LINE>As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.</LINE>
<LINE>And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.</LINE>
<LINE>Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,</LINE>
<LINE>In resolution as I swore before.</LINE>

<LINE>Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace</LINE>
<LINE>As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,</LINE>
<LINE>And have forsworn you with Hortensio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress, we have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then we are rid of Licio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God give him joy!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and he'll tame her.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He says so, Tranio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The taming-school! what, is there such a place?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;</LINE>
<LINE>That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,</LINE>
<LINE>To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter BIONDELLO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O master, master, I have watch'd so long</LINE>
<LINE>That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied</LINE>
<LINE>An ancient angel coming down the hill,</LINE>
<LINE>Will serve the turn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is he, Biondello?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,</LINE>
<LINE>I know not what; but format in apparel,</LINE>
<LINE>In gait and countenance surely like a father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what of him, Tranio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he be credulous and trust my tale,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,</LINE>
<LINE>And give assurance to Baptista Minola,</LINE>
<LINE>As if he were the right Vincentio</LINE>
<LINE>Take in your love, and then let me alone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter a Pedant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pedant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God save you, sir!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you, sir! you are welcome.</LINE>
<LINE>Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pedant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:</LINE>
<LINE>But then up farther, and as for as Rome;</LINE>
<LINE>And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What countryman, I pray?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pedant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of Mantua.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!</LINE>
<LINE>And come to Padua, careless of your life?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pedant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis death for any one in Mantua</LINE>
<LINE>To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?</LINE>
<LINE>Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,</LINE>
<LINE>For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,</LINE>
<LINE>You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pedant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;</LINE>
<LINE>For I have bills for money by exchange</LINE>
<LINE>From Florence and must here deliver them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, to do you courtesy,</LINE>
<LINE>This will I do, and this I will advise you:</LINE>
<LINE>First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pedant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,</LINE>
<LINE>Pisa renowned for grave citizens.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Among them know you one Vincentio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pedant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know him not, but I have heard of him;</LINE>
<LINE>A merchant of incomparable wealth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,</LINE>
<LINE>In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  As much as an apple doth an oyster,</LINE>
<LINE>and all one.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To save your life in this extremity,</LINE>
<LINE>This favour will I do you for his sake;</LINE>
<LINE>And think it not the worst of an your fortunes</LINE>
<LINE>That you are like to Sir Vincentio.</LINE>
<LINE>His name and credit shall you undertake,</LINE>
<LINE>And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:</LINE>
<LINE>Look that you take upon you as you should;</LINE>
<LINE>You understand me, sir: so shall you stay</LINE>
<LINE>Till you have done your business in the city:</LINE>
<LINE>If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pedant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O sir, I do; and will repute you ever</LINE>
<LINE>The patron of my life and liberty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then go with me to make the matter good.</LINE>
<LINE>This, by the way, I let you understand;</LINE>
<LINE>my father is here look'd for every day,</LINE>
<LINE>To pass assurance of a dower in marriage</LINE>
<LINE>'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:</LINE>
<LINE>In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:</LINE>
<LINE>Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE III.  A room in PETRUCHIO'S house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter KATHARINA and GRUMIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:</LINE>
<LINE>What, did he marry me to famish me?</LINE>
<LINE>Beggars, that come unto my father's door,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon entreaty have a present aims;</LINE>
<LINE>If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:</LINE>
<LINE>But I, who never knew how to entreat,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor never needed that I should entreat,</LINE>
<LINE>Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:</LINE>
<LINE>And that which spites me more than all these wants,</LINE>
<LINE>He does it under name of perfect love;</LINE>
<LINE>As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,</LINE>
<LINE>'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.</LINE>
<LINE>I prithee go and get me some repast;</LINE>
<LINE>I care not what, so it be wholesome food.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say you to a neat's foot?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I fear it is too choleric a meat.</LINE>
<LINE>How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.</LINE>
<LINE>What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dish that I do love to feed upon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else you get no beef of Grumio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, the mustard without the beef.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Beats him</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>That feed'st me with the very name of meat:</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,</LINE>
<LINE>That triumph thus upon my misery!</LINE>
<LINE>Go, get thee gone, I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress, what cheer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, as cold as can be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.</LINE>
<LINE>Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am</LINE>
<LINE>To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:</LINE>
<LINE>I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.</LINE>
<LINE>What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;</LINE>
<LINE>And all my pains is sorted to no proof.</LINE>
<LINE>Here, take away this dish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you, let it stand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The poorest service is repaid with thanks;</LINE>
<LINE>And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.</LINE>
<LINE>Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!</LINE>
<LINE>Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,</LINE>
<LINE>Will we return unto thy father's house</LINE>
<LINE>And revel it as bravely as the best,</LINE>
<LINE>With silken coats and caps and golden rings,</LINE>
<LINE>With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things;</LINE>
<LINE>With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,</LINE>
<LINE>With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery.</LINE>
<LINE>What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,</LINE>
<LINE>To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Tailor</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;</LINE>
<LINE>Lay forth the gown.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Haberdasher</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>What news with you, sir?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Haberdasher</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this was moulded on a porringer;</LINE>
<LINE>A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:</LINE>
<LINE>Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,</LINE>
<LINE>A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:</LINE>
<LINE>Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,</LINE>
<LINE>And gentlewomen wear such caps as these</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>When you are gentle, you shall have one too,</LINE>
<LINE>And not till then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  That will not be in haste.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;</LINE>
<LINE>And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:</LINE>
<LINE>Your betters have endured me say my mind,</LINE>
<LINE>And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else my heart concealing it will break,</LINE>
<LINE>And rather than it shall, I will be free</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,</LINE>
<LINE>A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:</LINE>
<LINE>I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Love me or love me not, I like the cap;</LINE>
<LINE>And it I will have, or I will have none.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit Haberdasher</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.</LINE>
<LINE>O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?</LINE>
<LINE>What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:</LINE>
<LINE>What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?</LINE>
<LINE>Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a censer in a barber's shop:</LINE>
<LINE>Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You bid me make it orderly and well,</LINE>
<LINE>According to the fashion and the time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,</LINE>
<LINE>I did not bid you mar it to the time.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, hop me over every kennel home,</LINE>
<LINE>For you shall hop without my custom, sir:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,</LINE>
<LINE>More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:</LINE>
<LINE>Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She says your worship means to make</LINE>
<LINE>a puppet of her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,</LINE>
<LINE>thou thimble,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!</LINE>
<LINE>Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?</LINE>
<LINE>Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;</LINE>
<LINE>Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard</LINE>
<LINE>As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!</LINE>
<LINE>I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your worship is deceived; the gown is made</LINE>
<LINE>Just as my master had direction:</LINE>
<LINE>Grumio gave order how it should be done.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But how did you desire it should be made?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, sir, with needle and thread.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But did you not request to have it cut?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast faced many things.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not</LINE>
<LINE>me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto</LINE>
<LINE>thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did</LINE>
<LINE>not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Read it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown:'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in</LINE>
<LINE>the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom</LINE>
<LINE>of brown thread: I said a gown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Proceed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>  'With a small compassed cape:'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I confess the cape.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>  'With a trunk sleeve:'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I confess two sleeves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>  'The sleeves curiously cut.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, there's the villany.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.</LINE>
<LINE>I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and</LINE>
<LINE>sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,</LINE>
<LINE>though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Tailor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is true that I say: an I had thee</LINE>
<LINE>in place where, thou shouldst know it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am for thee straight: take thou the</LINE>
<LINE>bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, take it up unto thy master's use.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'</LINE>
<LINE>gown for thy master's use!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GRUMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:</LINE>
<LINE>Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!</LINE>
<LINE>O, fie, fie, fie!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.</LINE>
<LINE>Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:</LINE>
<LINE>Take no unkindness of his hasty words:</LINE>
<LINE>Away! I say; commend me to thy master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit Tailor</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's</LINE>
<LINE>Even in these honest mean habiliments:</LINE>
<LINE>Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;</LINE>
<LINE>For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;</LINE>
<LINE>And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,</LINE>
<LINE>So honour peereth in the meanest habit.</LINE>
<LINE>What is the jay more precious than the lark,</LINE>
<LINE>Because his fathers are more beautiful?</LINE>
<LINE>Or is the adder better than the eel,</LINE>
<LINE>Because his painted skin contents the eye?</LINE>
<LINE>O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse</LINE>
<LINE>For this poor furniture and mean array.</LINE>
<LINE>if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,</LINE>
<LINE>To feast and sport us at thy father's house.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;</LINE>
<LINE>And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;</LINE>
<LINE>There will we mount, and thither walk on foot</LINE>
<LINE>Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,</LINE>
<LINE>And well we may come there by dinner-time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;</LINE>
<LINE>And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It shall be seven ere I go to horse:</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE IV.  Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter TRANIO, and the Pedant dressed like VINCENTIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pedant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, what else? and but I be deceived</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Baptista may remember me,</LINE>
<LINE>Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,</LINE>
<LINE>Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,</LINE>
<LINE>With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pedant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I warrant you.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BIONDELLO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>But, sir, here comes your boy;</LINE>
<LINE>'Twere good he were school'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,</LINE>
<LINE>Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:</LINE>
<LINE>Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, fear not me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I told him that your father was at Venice,</LINE>
<LINE>And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.</LINE>
<LINE>Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Signior Baptista, you are happily met.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To the Pedant</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you stand good father to me now,</LINE>
<LINE>Give me Bianca for my patrimony.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Pedant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Soft son!</LINE>
<LINE>Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua</LINE>
<LINE>To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio</LINE>
<LINE>Made me acquainted with a weighty cause</LINE>
<LINE>Of love between your daughter and himself:</LINE>
<LINE>And, for the good report I hear of you</LINE>
<LINE>And for the love he beareth to your daughter</LINE>
<LINE>And she to him, to stay him not too long,</LINE>
<LINE>I am content, in a good father's care,</LINE>
<LINE>To have him match'd; and if you please to like</LINE>
<LINE>No worse than I, upon some agreement</LINE>
<LINE>Me shall you find ready and willing</LINE>
<LINE>With one consent to have her so bestow'd;</LINE>
<LINE>For curious I cannot be with you,</LINE>
<LINE>Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:</LINE>
<LINE>Your plainness and your shortness please me well.</LINE>
<LINE>Right true it is, your son Lucentio here</LINE>
<LINE>Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,</LINE>
<LINE>Or both dissemble deeply their affections:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, if you say no more than this,</LINE>
<LINE>That like a father you will deal with him</LINE>
<LINE>And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,</LINE>
<LINE>The match is made, and all is done:</LINE>
<LINE>Your son shall have my daughter with consent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best</LINE>
<LINE>We be affied and such assurance ta'en</LINE>
<LINE>As shall with either part's agreement stand?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,</LINE>
<LINE>Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;</LINE>
<LINE>And happily we might be interrupted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then at my lodging, an it like you:</LINE>
<LINE>There doth my father lie; and there, this night,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll pass the business privately and well.</LINE>
<LINE>Send for your daughter by your servant here:</LINE>
<LINE>My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.</LINE>
<LINE>The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,</LINE>
<LINE>You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid Bianca make her ready straight;</LINE>
<LINE>And, if you will, tell what hath happened,</LINE>
<LINE>Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,</LINE>
<LINE>And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray the gods she may with all my heart!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit BIONDELLO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?</LINE>
<LINE>Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:</LINE>
<LINE>Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Biondello, what of that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to</LINE>
<LINE>expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray thee, moralize them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the</LINE>
<LINE>deceiving father of a deceitful son.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what of him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what of all this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a</LINE>
<LINE>counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,</LINE>
<LINE>'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the</LINE>
<LINE>church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient</LINE>
<LINE>honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,</LINE>
<LINE>I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for</LINE>
<LINE>ever and a day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hearest thou, Biondello?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an</LINE>
<LINE>afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to</LINE>
<LINE>stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,</LINE>
<LINE>sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint</LINE>
<LINE>Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against</LINE>
<LINE>you come with your appendix.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I may, and will, if she be so contented:</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:</LINE>

<LINE>Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?</LINE>
<LINE>Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?</LINE>
<LINE>Such war of white and red within her cheeks!</LINE>
<LINE>What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,</LINE>
<LINE>As those two eyes become that heavenly face?</LINE>
<LINE>Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.</LINE>

<LINE>Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:</LINE>
<LINE>This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>That have been so bedazzled with the sun</LINE>
<LINE>That everything I look on seemeth green:</LINE>

<LINE>My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;</LINE>

<LINE>A son of mine, which long I have not seen.</LINE>

<LINE>And now by law, as well as reverend age,</LINE>
<LINE>I may entitle thee my loving father:</LINE>
<LINE>The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,</LINE>
<LINE>Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;</LINE>
<LINE>Beside, so qualified as may beseem</LINE>
<LINE>The spouse of any noble gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>Let me embrace with old Vincentio,</LINE>
<LINE>And wander we to see thy honest son,</LINE>
<LINE>Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VINCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,</LINE>
<LINE>Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the company you overtake?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I dare not swear it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!</LINE>

<LINE>Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O</LINE>
<LINE>monstrous villain!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,</LINE>

<LINE><STAGEDIR>Kneeling</STAGEDIR>  Pardon, sweet father.</LINE>

<LINE>Pardon, dear father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How hast thou offended?</LINE>
<LINE>Where is Lucentio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's Lucentio,</LINE>
<LINE>Right son to the right Vincentio;</LINE>
<LINE>That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,</LINE>
<LINE>While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VINCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is that damned villain Tranio,</LINE>
<LINE>That faced and braved me in this matter so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cambio is changed into Lucentio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love</LINE>
<LINE>Made me exchange my state with Tranio,</LINE>
<LINE>While he did bear my countenance in the town;</LINE>
<LINE>And happily I have arrived at the last</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the wished haven of my bliss.</LINE>
<LINE>What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;</LINE>
<LINE>Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VINCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent</LINE>
<LINE>me to the gaol.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter</LINE>
<LINE>without asking my good will?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VINCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but</LINE>
<LINE>I will in, to be revenged for this villany.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>First kiss me, Kate, and we will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, in the midst of the street?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, art thou ashamed of me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the Pedant,
LUCENTIO, BIANCA, PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO,
and Widow, TRANIO, BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO the
Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:</LINE>
<LINE>And time it is, when raging war is done,</LINE>
<LINE>To smile at scapes and perils overblown.</LINE>
<LINE>My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,</LINE>
<LINE>While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.</LINE>
<LINE>Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,</LINE>
<LINE>And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,</LINE>
<LINE>Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:</LINE>
<LINE>My banquet is to close our stomachs up,</LINE>
<LINE>After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;</LINE>
<LINE>For now we sit to chat as well as eat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Padua affords nothing but what is kind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For both our sakes, I would that word were true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then never trust me, if I be afeard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:</LINE>
<LINE>I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Roundly replied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mistress, how mean you that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus I conceive by him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'</LINE>
<LINE>I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,</LINE>
<LINE>Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:</LINE>
<LINE>And now you know my meaning,</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A very mean meaning.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Right, I mean you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I am mean indeed, respecting you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To her, Kate!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To her, widow!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's my office.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, sir, they butt together well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body</LINE>
<LINE>Would say your head and butt were head and horn.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VINCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,</LINE>
<LINE>Have at you for a bitter jest or two!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;</LINE>
<LINE>And then pursue me as you draw your bow.</LINE>
<LINE>You are welcome all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.</LINE>
<LINE>This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,</LINE>
<LINE>Which runs himself and catches for his master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A good swift simile, but something currish.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>TRANIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;</LINE>
<LINE>And, as the jest did glance away from me,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,</LINE>
<LINE>I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance</LINE>
<LINE>Let's each one send unto his wife;</LINE>
<LINE>And he whose wife is most obedient</LINE>
<LINE>To come at first when he doth send for her,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall win the wager which we will propose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Content. What is the wager?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Twenty crowns.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Twenty crowns!</LINE>
<LINE>I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,</LINE>
<LINE>But twenty times so much upon my wife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A hundred then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.</LINE>

<LINE>I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter BIONDELLO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now! what news?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, my mistress sends you word</LINE>

<LINE>How! she is busy and she cannot come!</LINE>
<LINE>Is that an answer?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREMIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, and a kind one too:</LINE>
<LINE>Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I hope better.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife</LINE>
<LINE>To come to me forthwith.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit BIONDELLO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, ho! entreat her!</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, then she must needs come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am afraid, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter BIONDELLO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, where's my wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIONDELLO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She says you have some goodly jest in hand:</LINE>
<LINE>She will not come: she bids you come to her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,</LINE>
<LINE>Intolerable, not to be endured!</LINE>
<LINE>Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;</LINE>
<LINE>Say, I command her to come to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit GRUMIO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She will not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They sit conferring by the parlor fire.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.</LINE>
<LINE>Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:</LINE>
<LINE>Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit KATHARINA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,</LINE>
<LINE>And awful rule and right supremacy;</LINE>
<LINE>And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BAPTISTA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!</LINE>
<LINE>The wager thou hast won; and I will add</LINE>
<LINE>Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;</LINE>
<LINE>Another dowry to another daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>For she is changed, as she had never been.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, I will win my wager better yet</LINE>
<LINE>And show more sign of her obedience,</LINE>
<LINE>Her new-built virtue and obedience.</LINE>
<LINE>See where she comes and brings your froward wives</LINE>
<LINE>As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:</LINE>
<LINE>Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,</LINE>
<LINE>Till I be brought to such a silly pass!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would your duty were as foolish too:</LINE>
<LINE>The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BIANCA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The more fool you, for laying on my duty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women</LINE>
<LINE>What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come on, I say; and first begin with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Widow</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She shall not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say she shall: and first begin with her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINA</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,</LINE>
<LINE>And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:</LINE>
<LINE>It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,</LINE>
<LINE>Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,</LINE>
<LINE>And in no sense is meet or amiable.</LINE>
<LINE>A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,</LINE>
<LINE>Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;</LINE>
<LINE>And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty</LINE>
<LINE>Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And for thy maintenance commits his body</LINE>
<LINE>To painful labour both by sea and land,</LINE>
<LINE>To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,</LINE>
<LINE>Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;</LINE>
<LINE>And craves no other tribute at thy hands</LINE>
<LINE>But love, fair looks and true obedience;</LINE>
<LINE>Too little payment for so great a debt.</LINE>
<LINE>Such duty as the subject owes the prince</LINE>
<LINE>Even such a woman oweth to her husband;</LINE>
<LINE>And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,</LINE>
<LINE>And not obedient to his honest will,</LINE>
<LINE>What is she but a foul contending rebel</LINE>
<LINE>And graceless traitor to her loving lord?</LINE>
<LINE>I am ashamed that women are so simple</LINE>
<LINE>To offer war where they should kneel for peace;</LINE>
<LINE>Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,</LINE>
<LINE>When they are bound to serve, love and obey.</LINE>
<LINE>Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,</LINE>
<LINE>Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,</LINE>
<LINE>But that our soft conditions and our hearts</LINE>
<LINE>Should well agree with our external parts?</LINE>
<LINE>Come, come, you froward and unable worms!</LINE>
<LINE>My mind hath been as big as one of yours,</LINE>
<LINE>My heart as great, my reason haply more,</LINE>
<LINE>To bandy word for word and frown for frown;</LINE>
<LINE>But now I see our lances are but straws,</LINE>
<LINE>Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,</LINE>
<LINE>That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.</LINE>
<LINE>Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,</LINE>
<LINE>And place your hands below your husband's foot:</LINE>
<LINE>In token of which duty, if he please,</LINE>
<LINE>My hand is ready; may it do him ease.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VINCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>LUCENTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But a harsh hearing when women are froward.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETRUCHIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Kate, we'll to bed.</LINE>
<LINE>We three are married, but you two are sped.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To LUCENTIO</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;</LINE>
<LINE>And, being a winner, God give you good night!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORTENSIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.</LINE>
