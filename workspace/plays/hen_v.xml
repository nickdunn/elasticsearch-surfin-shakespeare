<LINE>O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend</LINE>
<LINE>The brightest heaven of invention,</LINE>
<LINE>A kingdom for a stage, princes to act</LINE>
<LINE>And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</LINE>
<LINE>Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</LINE>
<LINE>Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,</LINE>
<LINE>Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire</LINE>
<LINE>Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,</LINE>
<LINE>The flat unraised spirits that have dared</LINE>
<LINE>On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</LINE>
<LINE>So great an object: can this cockpit hold</LINE>
<LINE>The vasty fields of France? or may we cram</LINE>
<LINE>Within this wooden O the very casques</LINE>
<LINE>That did affright the air at Agincourt?</LINE>
<LINE>O, pardon! since a crooked figure may</LINE>

<LINE>And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,</LINE>
<LINE>Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign</LINE>
<LINE>Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,</LINE>
<LINE>But that the scambling and unquiet time</LINE>
<LINE>Did push it out of farther question.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It must be thought on. If it pass against us,</LINE>
<LINE>We lose the better half of our possession:</LINE>
<LINE>For all the temporal lands which men devout</LINE>
<LINE>By testament have given to the church</LINE>
<LINE>Would they strip from us; being valued thus:</LINE>
<LINE>As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,</LINE>
<LINE>Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,</LINE>
<LINE>Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;</LINE>
<LINE>And, to relief of lazars and weak age,</LINE>
<LINE>Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.</LINE>
<LINE>A hundred almshouses right well supplied;</LINE>
<LINE>And to the coffers of the king beside,</LINE>
<LINE>A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This would drink deep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Twould drink the cup and all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what prevention?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king is full of grace and fair regard.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And a true lover of the holy church.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The courses of his youth promised it not.</LINE>
<LINE>The breath no sooner left his father's body,</LINE>
<LINE>But that his wildness, mortified in him,</LINE>
<LINE>Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment</LINE>
<LINE>Consideration, like an angel, came</LINE>
<LINE>And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,</LINE>
<LINE>Leaving his body as a paradise,</LINE>
<LINE>To envelop and contain celestial spirits.</LINE>
<LINE>Never was such a sudden scholar made;</LINE>
<LINE>Never came reformation in a flood,</LINE>
<LINE>With such a heady currance, scouring faults</LINE>
<LINE>Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness</LINE>
<LINE>So soon did lose his seat and all at once</LINE>
<LINE>As in this king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are blessed in the change.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear him but reason in divinity,</LINE>
<LINE>And all-admiring with an inward wish</LINE>
<LINE>You would desire the king were made a prelate:</LINE>
<LINE>Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</LINE>
<LINE>You would say it hath been all in all his study:</LINE>
<LINE>List his discourse of war, and you shall hear</LINE>
<LINE>A fearful battle render'd you in music:</LINE>
<LINE>Turn him to any cause of policy,</LINE>
<LINE>The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,</LINE>
<LINE>Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,</LINE>
<LINE>The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,</LINE>
<LINE>And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,</LINE>
<LINE>To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;</LINE>
<LINE>So that the art and practic part of life</LINE>
<LINE>Must be the mistress to this theoric:</LINE>
<LINE>Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,</LINE>
<LINE>Since his addiction was to courses vain,</LINE>
<LINE>His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,</LINE>
<LINE>His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,</LINE>
<LINE>And never noted in him any study,</LINE>
<LINE>Any retirement, any sequestration</LINE>
<LINE>From open haunts and popularity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The strawberry grows underneath the nettle</LINE>
<LINE>And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</LINE>
<LINE>Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:</LINE>
<LINE>And so the prince obscured his contemplation</LINE>
<LINE>Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,</LINE>
<LINE>Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</LINE>
<LINE>Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It must be so; for miracles are ceased;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore we must needs admit the means</LINE>
<LINE>How things are perfected.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, my good lord,</LINE>
<LINE>How now for mitigation of this bill</LINE>
<LINE>Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty</LINE>
<LINE>Incline to it, or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He seems indifferent,</LINE>
<LINE>Or rather swaying more upon our part</LINE>
<LINE>Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;</LINE>
<LINE>For I have made an offer to his majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon our spiritual convocation</LINE>
<LINE>And in regard of causes now in hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I have open'd to his grace at large,</LINE>
<LINE>As touching France, to give a greater sum</LINE>
<LINE>Than ever at one time the clergy yet</LINE>
<LINE>Did to his predecessors part withal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How did this offer seem received, my lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With good acceptance of his majesty;</LINE>
<LINE>Save that there was not time enough to hear,</LINE>
<LINE>As I perceived his grace would fain have done,</LINE>
<LINE>The severals and unhidden passages</LINE>
<LINE>Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms</LINE>
<LINE>And generally to the crown and seat of France</LINE>
<LINE>Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What was the impediment that broke this off?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The French ambassador upon that instant</LINE>
<LINE>Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come</LINE>
<LINE>To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then go we in, to know his embassy;</LINE>
<LINE>Which I could with a ready guess declare,</LINE>
<LINE>Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not here in presence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Send for him, good uncle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,</LINE>
<LINE>Before we hear him, of some things of weight</LINE>
<LINE>That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God and his angels guard your sacred throne</LINE>
<LINE>And make you long become it!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sure, we thank you.</LINE>
<LINE>My learned lord, we pray you to proceed</LINE>
<LINE>And justly and religiously unfold</LINE>
<LINE>Why the law Salique that they have in France</LINE>
<LINE>Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:</LINE>
<LINE>And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</LINE>
<LINE>That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,</LINE>
<LINE>Or nicely charge your understanding soul</LINE>
<LINE>With opening titles miscreate, whose right</LINE>
<LINE>Suits not in native colours with the truth;</LINE>
<LINE>For God doth know how many now in health</LINE>
<LINE>Shall drop their blood in approbation</LINE>
<LINE>Of what your reverence shall incite us to.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,</LINE>
<LINE>How you awake our sleeping sword of war:</LINE>
<LINE>We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;</LINE>
<LINE>For never two such kingdoms did contend</LINE>
<LINE>Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops</LINE>
<LINE>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint</LINE>
<LINE>'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords</LINE>
<LINE>That make such waste in brief mortality.</LINE>
<LINE>Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;</LINE>
<LINE>For we will hear, note and believe in heart</LINE>
<LINE>That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd</LINE>
<LINE>As pure as sin with baptism.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</LINE>
<LINE>That owe yourselves, your lives and services</LINE>
<LINE>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</LINE>
<LINE>To make against your highness' claim to France</LINE>
<LINE>But this, which they produce from Pharamond,</LINE>
<LINE>'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'</LINE>
<LINE>'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'</LINE>
<LINE>Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze</LINE>
<LINE>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</LINE>
<LINE>The founder of this law and female bar.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</LINE>
<LINE>That the land Salique is in Germany,</LINE>
<LINE>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</LINE>
<LINE>Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,</LINE>
<LINE>There left behind and settled certain French;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, holding in disdain the German women</LINE>
<LINE>For some dishonest manners of their life,</LINE>
<LINE>Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female</LINE>
<LINE>Should be inheritrix in Salique land:</LINE>
<LINE>Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,</LINE>
<LINE>Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.</LINE>
<LINE>Then doth it well appear that Salique law</LINE>
<LINE>Was not devised for the realm of France:</LINE>
<LINE>Nor did the French possess the Salique land</LINE>
<LINE>Until four hundred one and twenty years</LINE>
<LINE>After defunction of King Pharamond,</LINE>
<LINE>Idly supposed the founder of this law;</LINE>
<LINE>Who died within the year of our redemption</LINE>
<LINE>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</LINE>
<LINE>Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French</LINE>
<LINE>Beyond the river Sala, in the year</LINE>
<LINE>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</LINE>
<LINE>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</LINE>
<LINE>Did, as heir general, being descended</LINE>
<LINE>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</LINE>
<LINE>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</LINE>
<LINE>Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</LINE>
<LINE>Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</LINE>
<LINE>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</LINE>
<LINE>To find his title with some shows of truth,</LINE>
<LINE>'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</LINE>
<LINE>Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,</LINE>
<LINE>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</LINE>
<LINE>To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</LINE>
<LINE>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</LINE>
<LINE>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</LINE>
<LINE>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</LINE>
<LINE>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</LINE>
<LINE>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</LINE>
<LINE>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</LINE>
<LINE>Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:</LINE>
<LINE>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</LINE>
<LINE>Was re-united to the crown of France.</LINE>
<LINE>So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.</LINE>
<LINE>King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,</LINE>
<LINE>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</LINE>
<LINE>To hold in right and title of the female:</LINE>
<LINE>So do the kings of France unto this day;</LINE>
<LINE>Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law</LINE>
<LINE>To bar your highness claiming from the female,</LINE>
<LINE>And rather choose to hide them in a net</LINE>
<LINE>Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</LINE>
<LINE>Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May I with right and conscience make this claim?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!</LINE>
<LINE>For in the book of Numbers is it writ,</LINE>
<LINE>When the man dies, let the inheritance</LINE>
<LINE>Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;</LINE>
<LINE>Look back into your mighty ancestors:</LINE>
<LINE>Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,</LINE>
<LINE>From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,</LINE>
<LINE>Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,</LINE>
<LINE>Making defeat on the full power of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles his most mighty father on a hill</LINE>
<LINE>Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp</LINE>
<LINE>Forage in blood of French nobility.</LINE>
<LINE>O noble English. that could entertain</LINE>
<LINE>With half their forces the full Pride of France</LINE>
<LINE>And let another half stand laughing by,</LINE>
<LINE>All out of work and cold for action!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ELY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Awake remembrance of these valiant dead</LINE>
<LINE>And with your puissant arm renew their feats:</LINE>
<LINE>You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;</LINE>
<LINE>The blood and courage that renowned them</LINE>
<LINE>Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege</LINE>
<LINE>Is in the very May-morn of his youth,</LINE>
<LINE>Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth</LINE>
<LINE>Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>As did the former lions of your blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They know your grace hath cause and means and might;</LINE>
<LINE>So hath your highness; never king of England</LINE>
<LINE>Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England</LINE>
<LINE>And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,</LINE>
<LINE>With blood and sword and fire to win your right;</LINE>
<LINE>In aid whereof we of the spiritualty</LINE>
<LINE>Will raise your highness such a mighty sum</LINE>
<LINE>As never did the clergy at one time</LINE>
<LINE>Bring in to any of your ancestors.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We must not only arm to invade the French,</LINE>
<LINE>But lay down our proportions to defend</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Scot, who will make road upon us</LINE>
<LINE>With all advantages.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They of those marches, gracious sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be a wall sufficient to defend</LINE>
<LINE>Our inland from the pilfering borderers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,</LINE>
<LINE>But fear the main intendment of the Scot,</LINE>
<LINE>Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;</LINE>
<LINE>For you shall read that my great-grandfather</LINE>
<LINE>Never went with his forces into France</LINE>
<LINE>But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom</LINE>
<LINE>Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,</LINE>
<LINE>With ample and brim fulness of his force,</LINE>
<LINE>Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,</LINE>
<LINE>Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;</LINE>
<LINE>That England, being empty of defence,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;</LINE>
<LINE>For hear her but exampled by herself:</LINE>
<LINE>When all her chivalry hath been in France</LINE>
<LINE>And she a mourning widow of her nobles,</LINE>
<LINE>She hath herself not only well defended</LINE>
<LINE>But taken and impounded as a stray</LINE>
<LINE>The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,</LINE>
<LINE>To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings</LINE>
<LINE>And make her chronicle as rich with praise</LINE>
<LINE>As is the ooze and bottom of the sea</LINE>
<LINE>With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But there's a saying very old and true,</LINE>
<LINE>'If that you will France win,</LINE>
<LINE>Then with Scotland first begin:'</LINE>
<LINE>For once the eagle England being in prey,</LINE>
<LINE>To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot</LINE>
<LINE>Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,</LINE>
<LINE>Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,</LINE>
<LINE>To tear and havoc more than she can eat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It follows then the cat must stay at home:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,</LINE>
<LINE>Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,</LINE>
<LINE>And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.</LINE>
<LINE>While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,</LINE>
<LINE>The advised head defends itself at home;</LINE>
<LINE>For government, though high and low and lower,</LINE>
<LINE>Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,</LINE>
<LINE>Congreeing in a full and natural close,</LINE>
<LINE>Like music.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CANTERBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore doth heaven divide</LINE>
<LINE>The state of man in divers functions,</LINE>
<LINE>Setting endeavour in continual motion;</LINE>
<LINE>To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,</LINE>
<LINE>Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,</LINE>
<LINE>Creatures that by a rule in nature teach</LINE>
<LINE>The act of order to a peopled kingdom.</LINE>
<LINE>They have a king and officers of sorts;</LINE>
<LINE>Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,</LINE>
<LINE>Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,</LINE>
<LINE>Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,</LINE>
<LINE>Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,</LINE>
<LINE>Which pillage they with merry march bring home</LINE>
<LINE>To the tent-royal of their emperor;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, busied in his majesty, surveys</LINE>
<LINE>The singing masons building roofs of gold,</LINE>
<LINE>The civil citizens kneading up the honey,</LINE>
<LINE>The poor mechanic porters crowding in</LINE>
<LINE>Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,</LINE>
<LINE>The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,</LINE>
<LINE>Delivering o'er to executors pale</LINE>
<LINE>The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,</LINE>
<LINE>That many things, having full reference</LINE>
<LINE>To one consent, may work contrariously:</LINE>
<LINE>As many arrows, loosed several ways,</LINE>
<LINE>Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;</LINE>
<LINE>As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;</LINE>
<LINE>As many lines close in the dial's centre;</LINE>
<LINE>So may a thousand actions, once afoot.</LINE>
<LINE>End in one purpose, and be all well borne</LINE>
<LINE>Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.</LINE>
<LINE>Divide your happy England into four;</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof take you one quarter into France,</LINE>
<LINE>And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.</LINE>
<LINE>If we, with thrice such powers left at home,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt some Attendants</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,</LINE>
<LINE>And yours, the noble sinews of our power,</LINE>
<LINE>France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,</LINE>
<LINE>Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,</LINE>
<LINE>Ruling in large and ample empery</LINE>
<LINE>O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,</LINE>
<LINE>Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,</LINE>
<LINE>Tombless, with no remembrance over them:</LINE>
<LINE>Either our history shall with full mouth</LINE>
<LINE>Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,</LINE>
<LINE>Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,</LINE>
<LINE>Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter Ambassadors of France</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure</LINE>
<LINE>Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear</LINE>
<LINE>Your greeting is from him, not from the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Ambassador</SPEAKER>
<LINE>May't please your majesty to give us leave</LINE>
<LINE>Freely to render what we have in charge;</LINE>
<LINE>Or shall we sparingly show you far off</LINE>
<LINE>The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;</LINE>
<LINE>Unto whose grace our passion is as subject</LINE>
<LINE>As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness</LINE>
<LINE>Tell us the Dauphin's mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Ambassador</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus, then, in few.</LINE>
<LINE>Your highness, lately sending into France,</LINE>
<LINE>Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right</LINE>
<LINE>Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.</LINE>
<LINE>In answer of which claim, the prince our master</LINE>
<LINE>Says that you savour too much of your youth,</LINE>
<LINE>And bids you be advised there's nought in France</LINE>
<LINE>That can be with a nimble galliard won;</LINE>
<LINE>You cannot revel into dukedoms there.</LINE>
<LINE>He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,</LINE>
<LINE>This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,</LINE>
<LINE>Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim</LINE>
<LINE>Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What treasure, uncle?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tennis-balls, my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;</LINE>
<LINE>His present and your pains we thank you for:</LINE>
<LINE>When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,</LINE>
<LINE>We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set</LINE>
<LINE>Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler</LINE>
<LINE>That all the courts of France will be disturb'd</LINE>
<LINE>With chaces. And we understand him well,</LINE>
<LINE>How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,</LINE>
<LINE>Not measuring what use we made of them.</LINE>
<LINE>We never valued this poor seat of England;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, living hence, did give ourself</LINE>
<LINE>To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common</LINE>
<LINE>That men are merriest when they are from home.</LINE>
<LINE>But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,</LINE>
<LINE>Be like a king and show my sail of greatness</LINE>
<LINE>When I do rouse me in my throne of France:</LINE>
<LINE>For that I have laid by my majesty</LINE>
<LINE>And plodded like a man for working-days,</LINE>
<LINE>But I will rise there with so full a glory</LINE>
<LINE>That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.</LINE>
<LINE>And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his</LINE>
<LINE>Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul</LINE>
<LINE>Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance</LINE>
<LINE>That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows</LINE>
<LINE>Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;</LINE>
<LINE>Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;</LINE>
<LINE>And some are yet ungotten and unborn</LINE>
<LINE>That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.</LINE>
<LINE>But this lies all within the will of God,</LINE>
<LINE>To whom I do appeal; and in whose name</LINE>
<LINE>Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,</LINE>
<LINE>To venge me as I may and to put forth</LINE>
<LINE>My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.</LINE>
<LINE>So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin</LINE>
<LINE>His jest will savour but of shallow wit,</LINE>
<LINE>When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.</LINE>
<LINE>Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.</LINE>

<LINE>This was a merry message.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We hope to make the sender blush at it.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour</LINE>
<LINE>That may give furtherance to our expedition;</LINE>
<LINE>For we have now no thought in us but France,</LINE>
<LINE>Save those to God, that run before our business.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore let our proportions for these wars</LINE>
<LINE>Be soon collected and all things thought upon</LINE>
<LINE>That may with reasonable swiftness add</LINE>
<LINE>More feathers to our wings; for, God before,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore let every man now task his thought,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Chorus</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now all the youth of England are on fire,</LINE>
<LINE>And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:</LINE>
<LINE>Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought</LINE>
<LINE>Reigns solely in the breast of every man:</LINE>
<LINE>They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,</LINE>
<LINE>Following the mirror of all Christian kings,</LINE>
<LINE>With winged heels, as English Mercuries.</LINE>
<LINE>For now sits Expectation in the air,</LINE>
<LINE>And hides a sword from hilts unto the point</LINE>
<LINE>With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,</LINE>
<LINE>Promised to Harry and his followers.</LINE>
<LINE>The French, advised by good intelligence</LINE>
<LINE>Of this most dreadful preparation,</LINE>
<LINE>Shake in their fear and with pale policy</LINE>
<LINE>Seek to divert the English purposes.</LINE>
<LINE>O England! model to thy inward greatness,</LINE>
<LINE>Like little body with a mighty heart,</LINE>
<LINE>What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,</LINE>
<LINE>Were all thy children kind and natural!</LINE>
<LINE>But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out</LINE>
<LINE>A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills</LINE>
<LINE>With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,</LINE>
<LINE>One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,</LINE>
<LINE>Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,</LINE>
<LINE>Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!</LINE>
<LINE>Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;</LINE>
<LINE>And by their hands this grace of kings must die,</LINE>
<LINE>If hell and treason hold their promises,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.</LINE>
<LINE>Linger your patience on; and we'll digest</LINE>
<LINE>The abuse of distance; force a play:</LINE>
<LINE>The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;</LINE>
<LINE>The king is set from London; and the scene</LINE>
<LINE>Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;</LINE>
<LINE>There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:</LINE>
<LINE>And thence to France shall we convey you safe,</LINE>
<LINE>And bring you back, charming the narrow seas</LINE>
<LINE>To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well met, Corporal Nym.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For my part, I care not: I say little; but when</LINE>
<LINE>time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that</LINE>
<LINE>shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will</LINE>
<LINE>wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but</LINE>
<LINE>what though? it will toast cheese, and it will</LINE>
<LINE>endure cold as another man's sword will: and</LINE>
<LINE>there's an end.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and</LINE>
<LINE>we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it</LINE>
<LINE>be so, good Corporal Nym.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the</LINE>
<LINE>certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I</LINE>
<LINE>will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the</LINE>
<LINE>rendezvous of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell</LINE>
<LINE>Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you</LINE>
<LINE>were troth-plight to her.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may</LINE>
<LINE>sleep, and they may have their throats about them at</LINE>
<LINE>that time; and some say knives have edges. It must</LINE>
<LINE>be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet</LINE>
<LINE>she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I</LINE>
<LINE>cannot tell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter PISTOL and Hostess</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good</LINE>
<LINE>corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,</LINE>
<LINE>I swear, I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and</LINE>
<LINE>board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live</LINE>
<LINE>honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will</LINE>
<LINE>be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>NYM and PISTOL draw</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn now! we</LINE>
<LINE>shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pish!</LINE>

<LINE>Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you shog off? I would have you solus.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!</LINE>
<LINE>The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;</LINE>
<LINE>The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,</LINE>
<LINE>And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,</LINE>
<LINE>And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!</LINE>
<LINE>I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;</LINE>
<LINE>For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,</LINE>
<LINE>And flashing fire will follow.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an</LINE>
<LINE>humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow</LINE>
<LINE>foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my</LINE>
<LINE>rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk</LINE>
<LINE>off, I would prick your guts a little, in good</LINE>
<LINE>terms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O braggart vile and damned furious wight!</LINE>
<LINE>The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore exhale.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the</LINE>
<LINE>first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair</LINE>
<LINE>terms: that is the humour of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Couple a gorge!'</LINE>
<LINE>That is the word. I thee defy again.</LINE>
<LINE>O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?</LINE>
<LINE>No; to the spital go,</LINE>
<LINE>And from the powdering tub of infamy</LINE>
<LINE>Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,</LINE>
<LINE>Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:</LINE>
<LINE>I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly</LINE>
<LINE>For the only she; and--pauca, there's enough. Go to.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and</LINE>
<LINE>you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.</LINE>
<LINE>Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and</LINE>
<LINE>do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.</LINE>

<LINE>Is not this just? for I shall sutler be</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me thy hand.</LINE>

<LINE>Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.</LINE>
<LINE>My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,</LINE>
<LINE>And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:</LINE>
<LINE>Think you not that the powers we bear with us</LINE>
<LINE>Will cut their passage through the force of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Doing the execution and the act</LINE>
<LINE>For which we have in head assembled them?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SCROOP</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded</LINE>
<LINE>We carry not a heart with us from hence</LINE>
<LINE>That grows not in a fair consent with ours,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish</LINE>
<LINE>Success and conquest to attend on us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAMBRIDGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never was monarch better fear'd and loved</LINE>
<LINE>Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject</LINE>
<LINE>That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness</LINE>
<LINE>Under the sweet shade of your government.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True: those that were your father's enemies</LINE>
<LINE>Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you</LINE>
<LINE>With hearts create of duty and of zeal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;</LINE>
<LINE>And shall forget the office of our hand,</LINE>
<LINE>Sooner than quittance of desert and merit</LINE>
<LINE>According to the weight and worthiness.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,</LINE>
<LINE>Enlarge the man committed yesterday,</LINE>
<LINE>That rail'd against our person: we consider</LINE>
<LINE>it was excess of wine that set him on;</LINE>
<LINE>And on his more advice we pardon him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SCROOP</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's mercy, but too much security:</LINE>
<LINE>Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example</LINE>
<LINE>Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let us yet be merciful.</LINE>

<LINE>So may your highness, and yet punish too.</LINE>

<LINE>Alas, your too much love and care of me</LINE>

<LINE>Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye</LINE>
<LINE>When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,</LINE>
<LINE>Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,</LINE>
<LINE>Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care</LINE>

<LINE>Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:</LINE>
<LINE>Who are the late commissioners?</LINE>

<LINE>I one, my lord:</LINE>

<LINE>Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.</LINE>
<LINE>My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,</LINE>
<LINE>We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!</LINE>
<LINE>What see you in those papers that you lose</LINE>
<LINE>So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!</LINE>
<LINE>Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The mercy that was quick in us but late,</LINE>
<LINE>By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:</LINE>
<LINE>You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;</LINE>
<LINE>For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,</LINE>
<LINE>As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.</LINE>
<LINE>See you, my princes, and my noble peers,</LINE>
<LINE>These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,</LINE>
<LINE>You know how apt our love was to accord</LINE>
<LINE>To furnish him with all appertinents</LINE>
<LINE>Belonging to his honour; and this man</LINE>
<LINE>Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,</LINE>
<LINE>And sworn unto the practises of France,</LINE>
<LINE>To kill us here in Hampton: to the which</LINE>
<LINE>This knight, no less for bounty bound to us</LINE>
<LINE>Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,</LINE>
<LINE>What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,</LINE>
<LINE>Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!</LINE>
<LINE>Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,</LINE>
<LINE>That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,</LINE>
<LINE>May it be possible, that foreign hire</LINE>
<LINE>Could out of thee extract one spark of evil</LINE>
<LINE>That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,</LINE>
<LINE>That, though the truth of it stands off as gross</LINE>
<LINE>As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.</LINE>
<LINE>Treason and murder ever kept together,</LINE>
<LINE>As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,</LINE>
<LINE>Working so grossly in a natural cause,</LINE>
<LINE>That admiration did not whoop at them:</LINE>
<LINE>But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in</LINE>
<LINE>Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:</LINE>
<LINE>And whatsoever cunning fiend it was</LINE>
<LINE>That wrought upon thee so preposterously</LINE>
<LINE>Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:</LINE>
<LINE>All other devils that suggest by treasons</LINE>
<LINE>Do botch and bungle up damnation</LINE>
<LINE>With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd</LINE>
<LINE>From glistering semblances of piety;</LINE>
<LINE>But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,</LINE>
<LINE>Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.</LINE>
<LINE>If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus</LINE>
<LINE>Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,</LINE>
<LINE>He might return to vasty Tartar back,</LINE>
<LINE>And tell the legions 'I can never win</LINE>
<LINE>A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'</LINE>
<LINE>O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected</LINE>
<LINE>The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,</LINE>
<LINE>Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,</LINE>
<LINE>Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,</LINE>
<LINE>Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,</LINE>
<LINE>Not working with the eye without the ear,</LINE>
<LINE>And but in purged judgment trusting neither?</LINE>
<LINE>Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:</LINE>
<LINE>And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,</LINE>
<LINE>To mark the full-fraught man and best indued</LINE>
<LINE>With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;</LINE>
<LINE>For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like</LINE>
<LINE>Another fall of man. Their faults are open:</LINE>
<LINE>Arrest them to the answer of the law;</LINE>
<LINE>And God acquit them of their practises!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CAMBRIDGE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For me, the gold of France did not seduce;</LINE>
<LINE>Although I did admit it as a motive</LINE>
<LINE>The sooner to effect what I intended:</LINE>
<LINE>But God be thanked for prevention;</LINE>
<LINE>Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,</LINE>
<LINE>Beseeching God and you to pardon me.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never did faithful subject more rejoice</LINE>
<LINE>At the discovery of most dangerous treason</LINE>

<LINE>Prevented from a damned enterprise:</LINE>
<LINE>My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.</LINE>
<LINE>You have conspired against our royal person,</LINE>
<LINE>Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers</LINE>
<LINE>Received the golden earnest of our death;</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,</LINE>
<LINE>His princes and his peers to servitude,</LINE>
<LINE>His subjects to oppression and contempt</LINE>
<LINE>And his whole kingdom into desolation.</LINE>
<LINE>Touching our person seek we no revenge;</LINE>
<LINE>But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws</LINE>
<LINE>We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,</LINE>
<LINE>Poor miserable wretches, to your death:</LINE>
<LINE>The taste whereof, God of his mercy give</LINE>
<LINE>You patience to endure, and true repentance</LINE>
<LINE>Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guarded</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.</LINE>
<LINE>We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,</LINE>
<LINE>Since God so graciously hath brought to light</LINE>
<LINE>This dangerous treason lurking in our way</LINE>
<LINE>To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now</LINE>
<LINE>But every rub is smoothed on our way.</LINE>
<LINE>Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver</LINE>
<LINE>Our puissance into the hand of God,</LINE>
<LINE>Putting it straight in expedition.</LINE>
<LINE>Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:</LINE>
<LINE>No king of England, if not king of France.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; for my manly heart doth yearn.</LINE>
<LINE>Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:</LINE>
<LINE>Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead,</LINE>
<LINE>And we must yearn therefore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Hostess</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's</LINE>
<LINE>bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made</LINE>
<LINE>a finer end and went away an it had been any</LINE>
<LINE>christom child; a' parted even just between twelve</LINE>
<LINE>and one, even at the turning o' the tide: for after</LINE>
<LINE>I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with</LINE>
<LINE>flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knew</LINE>
<LINE>there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as</LINE>
<LINE>a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,</LINE>
<LINE>sir John!' quoth I 'what, man! be o' good</LINE>
<LINE>cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or</LINE>
<LINE>four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'</LINE>
<LINE>should not think of God; I hoped there was no need</LINE>
<LINE>to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So</LINE>
<LINE>a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my</LINE>
<LINE>hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as</LINE>
<LINE>cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and</LINE>
<LINE>they were as cold as any stone, and so upward and</LINE>
<LINE>upward, and all was as cold as any stone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They say he cried out of sack.</LINE>

<LINE>Nay, that a' did not.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, that a' did; and said they were devils</LINE>
<LINE>incarnate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he</LINE>

<LINE>A' said once, the devil would have him about women.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then</LINE>
<LINE>he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon</LINE>

<LINE>burning in hell-fire?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BARDOLPH</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Look to my chattels and my movables:</LINE>

<LINE>Trust none;</LINE>
<LINE>For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,</LINE>

<LINE>Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.</LINE>
<LINE>Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Enter the FRENCH KING, the DAUPHIN, the
DUKES of BERRI and BRETAGNE, the Constable, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING OF FRANCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus comes the English with full power upon us;</LINE>
<LINE>And more than carefully it us concerns</LINE>
<LINE>To answer royally in our defences.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,</LINE>
<LINE>Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,</LINE>
<LINE>And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,</LINE>
<LINE>To line and new repair our towns of war</LINE>
<LINE>With men of courage and with means defendant;</LINE>
<LINE>For England his approaches makes as fierce</LINE>
<LINE>As waters to the sucking of a gulf.</LINE>
<LINE>It fits us then to be as provident</LINE>
<LINE>As fear may teach us out of late examples</LINE>
<LINE>Left by the fatal and neglected English</LINE>
<LINE>Upon our fields.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My most redoubted father,</LINE>
<LINE>It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;</LINE>
<LINE>For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,</LINE>
<LINE>Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,</LINE>
<LINE>But that defences, musters, preparations,</LINE>
<LINE>Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,</LINE>
<LINE>As were a war in expectation.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth</LINE>
<LINE>To view the sick and feeble parts of France:</LINE>
<LINE>And let us do it with no show of fear;</LINE>
<LINE>No, with no more than if we heard that England</LINE>
<LINE>Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:</LINE>
<LINE>For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Her sceptre so fantastically borne</LINE>
<LINE>By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,</LINE>
<LINE>That fear attends her not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O peace, Prince Dauphin!</LINE>
<LINE>You are too much mistaken in this king:</LINE>
<LINE>Question your grace the late ambassadors,</LINE>
<LINE>With what great state he heard their embassy,</LINE>
<LINE>How well supplied with noble counsellors,</LINE>
<LINE>How modest in exception, and withal</LINE>
<LINE>How terrible in constant resolution,</LINE>
<LINE>And you shall find his vanities forespent</LINE>
<LINE>Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,</LINE>
<LINE>Covering discretion with a coat of folly;</LINE>
<LINE>As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots</LINE>
<LINE>That shall first spring and be most delicate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;</LINE>
<LINE>But though we think it so, it is no matter:</LINE>
<LINE>In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh</LINE>
<LINE>The enemy more mighty than he seems:</LINE>
<LINE>So the proportions of defence are fill'd;</LINE>
<LINE>Which of a weak or niggardly projection</LINE>
<LINE>Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting</LINE>
<LINE>A little cloth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING OF FRANCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Think we King Harry strong;</LINE>
<LINE>And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.</LINE>
<LINE>The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;</LINE>
<LINE>And he is bred out of that bloody strain</LINE>
<LINE>That haunted us in our familiar paths:</LINE>
<LINE>Witness our too much memorable shame</LINE>
<LINE>When Cressy battle fatally was struck,</LINE>
<LINE>And all our princes captiv'd by the hand</LINE>
<LINE>Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,</LINE>
<LINE>Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,</LINE>
<LINE>Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,</LINE>
<LINE>Mangle the work of nature and deface</LINE>
<LINE>The patterns that by God and by French fathers</LINE>
<LINE>Had twenty years been made. This is a stem</LINE>
<LINE>Of that victorious stock; and let us fear</LINE>
<LINE>The native mightiness and fate of him.</LINE>

<LINE>You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs</LINE>
<LINE>Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten</LINE>
<LINE>Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>Take up the English short, and let them know</LINE>
<LINE>Of what a monarchy you are the head:</LINE>
<LINE>Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin</LINE>
<LINE>As self-neglecting.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING OF FRANCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From our brother England?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>From him; and thus he greets your majesty.</LINE>
<LINE>He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,</LINE>
<LINE>That you divest yourself, and lay apart</LINE>
<LINE>The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>By law of nature and of nations, 'long</LINE>
<LINE>To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown</LINE>
<LINE>And all wide-stretched honours that pertain</LINE>
<LINE>By custom and the ordinance of times</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the crown of France. That you may know</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,</LINE>
<LINE>Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,</LINE>
<LINE>He sends you this most memorable line,</LINE>
<LINE>In every branch truly demonstrative;</LINE>
<LINE>Willing to overlook this pedigree:</LINE>
<LINE>And when you find him evenly derived</LINE>
<LINE>From his most famed of famous ancestors,</LINE>
<LINE>Edward the Third, he bids you then resign</LINE>
<LINE>Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held</LINE>
<LINE>From him the native and true challenger.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING OF FRANCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or else what follows?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown</LINE>
<LINE>Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,</LINE>
<LINE>In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,</LINE>
<LINE>That, if requiring fail, he will compel;</LINE>
<LINE>And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy</LINE>
<LINE>On the poor souls for whom this hungry war</LINE>
<LINE>Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head</LINE>
<LINE>Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries</LINE>
<LINE>The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,</LINE>
<LINE>For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.</LINE>
<LINE>This is his claim, his threatening and my message;</LINE>
<LINE>Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,</LINE>
<LINE>To whom expressly I bring greeting too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING OF FRANCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For us, we will consider of this further:</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow shall you bear our full intent</LINE>

<LINE>For the Dauphin,</LINE>
<LINE>I stand here for him: what to him from England?</LINE>

<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,</LINE>
<LINE>And any thing that may not misbecome</LINE>
<LINE>The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness</LINE>
<LINE>Do not, in grant of all demands at large,</LINE>
<LINE>Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,</LINE>
<LINE>That caves and womby vaultages of France</LINE>
<LINE>Shall chide your trespass and return your mock</LINE>
<LINE>In second accent of his ordnance.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, if my father render fair return,</LINE>
<LINE>It is against my will; for I desire</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing but odds with England: to that end,</LINE>
<LINE>As matching to his youth and vanity,</LINE>
<LINE>I did present him with the Paris balls.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,</LINE>
<LINE>Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:</LINE>
<LINE>And, be assured, you'll find a difference,</LINE>
<LINE>As we his subjects have in wonder found,</LINE>
<LINE>Between the promise of his greener days</LINE>
<LINE>And these he masters now: now he weighs time</LINE>
<LINE>Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read</LINE>
<LINE>In your own losses, if he stay in France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING OF FRANCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.</LINE>

<LINE>Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet</LINE>
<LINE>With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:</LINE>
<LINE>Play with your fancies, and in them behold</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;</LINE>
<LINE>Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give</LINE>
<LINE>To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,</LINE>
<LINE>Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,</LINE>
<LINE>Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think</LINE>
<LINE>You stand upon the ravage and behold</LINE>
<LINE>A city on the inconstant billows dancing;</LINE>
<LINE>For so appears this fleet majestical,</LINE>
<LINE>Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:</LINE>
<LINE>Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,</LINE>
<LINE>And leave your England, as dead midnight still,</LINE>
<LINE>Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,</LINE>

<LINE>Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;</LINE>
<LINE>Behold the ordnance on their carriages,</LINE>
<LINE>With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.</LINE>
<LINE>Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;</LINE>
<LINE>Tells Harry that the king doth offer him</LINE>
<LINE>Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,</LINE>
<LINE>Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.</LINE>

<LINE>Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,</LINE>
<LINE>Have in these parts from morn till even fought</LINE>
<LINE>And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:</LINE>
<LINE>Dishonour not your mothers; now attest</LINE>
<LINE>That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.</LINE>
<LINE>Be copy now to men of grosser blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose limbs were made in England, show us here</LINE>
<LINE>The mettle of your pasture; let us swear</LINE>
<LINE>That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;</LINE>

<SPEAKER>NYM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks are too hot;</LINE>
<LINE>and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives:</LINE>
<LINE>the humour of it is too hot, that is the very</LINE>
<LINE>plain-song of it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:</LINE>

<LINE>These be good humours! your honour wins bad humours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but Boy</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Boy</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As young as I am, I have observed these three</LINE>
<LINE>swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they</LINE>
<LINE>three, though they would serve me, could not be man</LINE>
<LINE>to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to</LINE>
<LINE>a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and</LINE>
<LINE>red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but</LINE>
<LINE>fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue</LINE>
<LINE>and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks</LINE>
<LINE>words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath</LINE>
<LINE>heard that men of few words are the best men; and</LINE>
<LINE>therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'</LINE>
<LINE>should be thought a coward: but his few bad words</LINE>
<LINE>are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never</LINE>
<LINE>broke any man's head but his own, and that was</LINE>
<LINE>against a post when he was drunk. They will steal</LINE>
<LINE>any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a</LINE>
<LINE>lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for</LINE>
<LINE>three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn</LINE>
<LINE>brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a</LINE>
<LINE>fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the</LINE>
<LINE>men would carry coals. They would have me as</LINE>
<LINE>familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their</LINE>
<LINE>handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,</LINE>
<LINE>if I should take from another's pocket to put into</LINE>
<LINE>mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I</LINE>
<LINE>must leave them, and seek some better service:</LINE>
<LINE>their villany goes against my weak stomach, and</LINE>
<LINE>therefore I must cast it up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<LINE>Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the</LINE>
<LINE>mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so good</LINE>
<LINE>to come to the mines; for, look you, the mines is</LINE>
<LINE>not according to the disciplines of the war: the</LINE>
<LINE>concavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you,</LINE>
<LINE>the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look</LINE>
<LINE>you, is digt himself four yard under the</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How yet resolves the governor of the town?</LINE>
<LINE>This is the latest parle we will admit;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;</LINE>
<LINE>Or like to men proud of destruction</LINE>
<LINE>Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,</LINE>
<LINE>A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,</LINE>
<LINE>If I begin the battery once again,</LINE>
<LINE>I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur</LINE>
<LINE>Till in her ashes she lie buried.</LINE>
<LINE>The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,</LINE>
<LINE>And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,</LINE>
<LINE>In liberty of bloody hand shall range</LINE>
<LINE>With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass</LINE>
<LINE>Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.</LINE>
<LINE>What is it then to me, if impious war,</LINE>
<LINE>Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,</LINE>
<LINE>Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats</LINE>
<LINE>Enlink'd to waste and desolation?</LINE>
<LINE>What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,</LINE>
<LINE>If your pure maidens fall into the hand</LINE>
<LINE>Of hot and forcing violation?</LINE>
<LINE>What rein can hold licentious wickedness</LINE>
<LINE>When down the hill he holds his fierce career?</LINE>
<LINE>We may as bootless spend our vain command</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil</LINE>
<LINE>As send precepts to the leviathan</LINE>
<LINE>To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,</LINE>
<LINE>Take pity of your town and of your people,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace</LINE>
<LINE>O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds</LINE>
<LINE>Of heady murder, spoil and villany.</LINE>
<LINE>If not, why, in a moment look to see</LINE>
<LINE>The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand</LINE>
<LINE>Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;</LINE>
<LINE>Your fathers taken by the silver beards,</LINE>
<LINE>And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,</LINE>
<LINE>Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused</LINE>
<LINE>Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry</LINE>
<LINE>At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.</LINE>
<LINE>What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,</LINE>
<LINE>Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOR</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our expectation hath this day an end:</LINE>
<LINE>The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,</LINE>
<LINE>Returns us that his powers are yet not ready</LINE>
<LINE>To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,</LINE>
<LINE>We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.</LINE>
<LINE>Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;</LINE>
<LINE>For we no longer are defensible.</LINE>

<LINE>Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,</LINE>
<LINE>Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,</LINE>
<LINE>And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:</LINE>
<LINE>Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,</LINE>
<LINE>The winter coming on and sickness growing</LINE>
<LINE>Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.</LINE>
<LINE>To-night in Harfleur we will be your guest;</LINE>

<LINE>Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat</LINE>
<LINE>The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:</LINE>
<LINE>Go down upon him, you have power enough,</LINE>
<LINE>And in a captive chariot into Rouen</LINE>
<LINE>Bring him our prisoner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This becomes the great.</LINE>
<LINE>Sorry am I his numbers are so few,</LINE>
<LINE>His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,</LINE>
<LINE>For I am sure, when he shall see our army,</LINE>
<LINE>He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear</LINE>
<LINE>And for achievement offer us his ransom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING OF FRANCE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy.</LINE>
<LINE>And let him say to England that we send</LINE>
<LINE>To know what willing ransom he will give.</LINE>
<LINE>Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not so, I do beseech your majesty.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Now forth, lord constable and princes all,</LINE>
<LINE>And quickly bring us word of England's fall.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE VI.  The English camp in Picardy.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter GOWER and FLUELLEN, meeting</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I assure you, there is very excellent services</LINE>
<LINE>committed at the bridge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is the Duke of Exeter safe?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;</LINE>
<LINE>and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and my</LINE>
<LINE>heart, and my duty, and my life, and my living, and</LINE>
<LINE>my uttermost power: he is not-God be praised and</LINE>
<LINE>blessed!--any hurt in the world; but keeps the</LINE>
<LINE>bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.</LINE>
<LINE>There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the</LINE>
<LINE>pridge, I think in my very conscience he is as</LINE>
<LINE>valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of no</LINE>
<LINE>estimation in the world; but did see him do as</LINE>
<LINE>gallant service.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What do you call him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is called Aunchient Pistol.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know him not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter PISTOL</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is the man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours:</LINE>
<LINE>The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love at</LINE>
<LINE>his hands.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,</LINE>
<LINE>And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,</LINE>
<LINE>And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,</LINE>
<LINE>That goddess blind,</LINE>
<LINE>That stands upon the rolling restless stone--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is</LINE>
<LINE>painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to</LINE>
<LINE>signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is</LINE>
<LINE>painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which</LINE>
<LINE>is the moral of it, that she is turning, and</LINE>
<LINE>inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her</LINE>
<LINE>foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,</LINE>
<LINE>which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,</LINE>
<LINE>the poet makes a most excellent description of it:</LINE>
<LINE>Fortune is an excellent moral.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;</LINE>
<LINE>For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:</LINE>
<LINE>A damned death!</LINE>
<LINE>Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free</LINE>
<LINE>And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:</LINE>
<LINE>But Exeter hath given the doom of death</LINE>
<LINE>For pax of little price.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:</LINE>
<LINE>And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut</LINE>
<LINE>With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:</LINE>
<LINE>Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why then, rejoice therefore.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice</LINE>
<LINE>at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would</LINE>
<LINE>desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put</LINE>
<LINE>him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PISTOL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Very good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I</LINE>
<LINE>remember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at the</LINE>
<LINE>bridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it</LINE>
<LINE>is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well,</LINE>
<LINE>I warrant you, when time is serve.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then</LINE>
<LINE>goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return</LINE>
<LINE>into London under the form of a soldier. And such</LINE>
<LINE>fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:</LINE>
<LINE>and they will learn you by rote where services were</LINE>
<LINE>done; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,</LINE>
<LINE>at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was</LINE>
<LINE>shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;</LINE>
<LINE>and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,</LINE>
<LINE>which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what</LINE>
<LINE>a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of</LINE>
<LINE>the camp will do among foaming bottles and</LINE>
<LINE>ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But</LINE>
<LINE>you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or</LINE>
<LINE>else you may be marvellously mistook.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he is</LINE>
<LINE>not the man that he would gladly make show to the</LINE>
<LINE>world he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will</LINE>
<LINE>tell him my mind.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has</LINE>
<LINE>very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is</LINE>
<LINE>gone off, look you; and there is gallant and most</LINE>
<LINE>prave passages; marry, th' athversary was have</LINE>
<LINE>possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to</LINE>
<LINE>retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the</LINE>
<LINE>pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a</LINE>
<LINE>prave man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What men have you lost, Fluellen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The perdition of th' athversary hath been very</LINE>
<LINE>great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I</LINE>
<LINE>think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that</LINE>
<LINE>is like to be executed for robbing a church, one</LINE>
<LINE>Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is</LINE>
<LINE>all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o'</LINE>
<LINE>fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like</LINE>
<LINE>a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;</LINE>
<LINE>but his nose is executed and his fire's out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we</LINE>
<LINE>give express charge, that in our marches through the</LINE>
<LINE>country, there be nothing compelled from the</LINE>
<LINE>villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the</LINE>
<LINE>French upbraided or abused in disdainful language;</LINE>
<LINE>for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the</LINE>
<LINE>gentler gamester is the soonest winner.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTJOY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You know me by my habit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTJOY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My master's mind.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unfold it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTJOY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:</LINE>
<LINE>Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage</LINE>
<LINE>is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we</LINE>
<LINE>could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we</LINE>
<LINE>thought not good to bruise an injury till it were</LINE>
<LINE>full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice</LINE>
<LINE>is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see</LINE>
<LINE>his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him</LINE>
<LINE>therefore consider of his ransom; which must</LINE>
<LINE>proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we</LINE>
<LINE>have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in</LINE>
<LINE>weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.</LINE>
<LINE>For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the</LINE>
<LINE>effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too</LINE>
<LINE>faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own</LINE>
<LINE>person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and</LINE>
<LINE>worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and</LINE>
<LINE>tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his</LINE>
<LINE>followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far</LINE>
<LINE>my king and master; so much my office.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is thy name? I know thy quality.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTJOY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Montjoy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.</LINE>
<LINE>And tell thy king I do not seek him now;</LINE>
<LINE>But could be willing to march on to Calais</LINE>
<LINE>Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,</LINE>
<LINE>Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much</LINE>
<LINE>Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,</LINE>
<LINE>My people are with sickness much enfeebled,</LINE>
<LINE>My numbers lessened, and those few I have</LINE>
<LINE>Almost no better than so many French;</LINE>
<LINE>Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,</LINE>
<LINE>I thought upon one pair of English legs</LINE>
<LINE>Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,</LINE>
<LINE>That I do brag thus! This your air of France</LINE>
<LINE>Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.</LINE>
<LINE>Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;</LINE>
<LINE>My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,</LINE>
<LINE>My army but a weak and sickly guard;</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,</LINE>
<LINE>Though France himself and such another neighbour</LINE>
<LINE>Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.</LINE>
<LINE>Go bid thy master well advise himself:</LINE>
<LINE>If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,</LINE>
<LINE>We shall your tawny ground with your red blood</LINE>
<LINE>Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.</LINE>
<LINE>The sum of all our answer is but this:</LINE>
<LINE>We would not seek a battle, as we are;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:</LINE>
<LINE>So tell your master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>MONTJOY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.</LINE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE VII.  The French camp, near Agincourt:</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter the Constable of France, the LORD RAMBURES,
ORLEANS, DAUPHIN, with others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is the best horse of Europe.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will it never be morning?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you</LINE>
<LINE>talk of horse and armour?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a long night is this! I will not change my</LINE>
<LINE>horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.</LINE>
<LINE>Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his</LINE>
<LINE>entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,</LINE>
<LINE>chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I</LINE>
<LINE>soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth</LINE>
<LINE>sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his</LINE>
<LINE>hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He's of the colour of the nutmeg.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for</LINE>
<LINE>Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull</LINE>
<LINE>elements of earth and water never appear in him, but</LINE>
<LINE>only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts</LINE>
<LINE>him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you</LINE>
<LINE>may call beasts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the</LINE>
<LINE>bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more, cousin.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the</LINE>
<LINE>rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary</LINE>
<LINE>deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as</LINE>
<LINE>fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent</LINE>
<LINE>tongues, and my horse is argument for them all:</LINE>
<LINE>'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for</LINE>
<LINE>a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the</LINE>
<LINE>world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart</LINE>
<LINE>their particular functions and wonder at him. I</LINE>
<LINE>once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:</LINE>
<LINE>'Wonder of nature,'--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then did they imitate that which I composed to my</LINE>
<LINE>courser, for my horse is my mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ORLEANS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your mistress bears well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Me well; which is the prescript praise and</LINE>
<LINE>perfection of a good and particular mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly</LINE>
<LINE>shook your back.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So perhaps did yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mine was not bridled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,</LINE>
<LINE>like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in</LINE>
<LINE>your straight strossers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You have good judgment in horsemanship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride</LINE>
<LINE>not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have</LINE>
<LINE>my horse to my mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I had as lief have my mistress a jade.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow</LINE>
<LINE>to my mistress.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et</LINE>
<LINE>la truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RAMBURES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord constable, the armour that I saw in your tent</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stars, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yet my sky shall not want.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and</LINE>
<LINE>'twere more honour some were away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even as your horse bears your praises; who would</LINE>
<LINE>trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DAUPHIN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will</LINE>
<LINE>it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and</LINE>
<LINE>my way shall be paved with English faces.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Constable</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of</LINE>
<LINE>my way: but I would it were morning; for I would</LINE>
<LINE>fain be about the ears of the English.</LINE>

<LINE>What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the</LINE>

<LINE>Now entertain conjecture of a time</LINE>
<LINE>When creeping murmur and the poring dark</LINE>
<LINE>Fills the wide vessel of the universe.</LINE>
<LINE>From camp to camp through the foul womb of night</LINE>
<LINE>The hum of either army stilly sounds,</LINE>
<LINE>That the fixed sentinels almost receive</LINE>
<LINE>The secret whispers of each other's watch:</LINE>
<LINE>Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames</LINE>
<LINE>Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;</LINE>
<LINE>Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs</LINE>
<LINE>Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents</LINE>
<LINE>The armourers, accomplishing the knights,</LINE>
<LINE>With busy hammers closing rivets up,</LINE>
<LINE>Give dreadful note of preparation:</LINE>
<LINE>The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,</LINE>
<LINE>And the third hour of drowsy morning name.</LINE>
<LINE>Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,</LINE>
<LINE>The confident and over-lusty French</LINE>
<LINE>Do the low-rated English play at dice;</LINE>
<LINE>And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night</LINE>
<LINE>Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp</LINE>
<LINE>So tediously away. The poor condemned English,</LINE>
<LINE>Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires</LINE>
<LINE>Sit patiently and inly ruminate</LINE>
<LINE>The morning's danger, and their gesture sad</LINE>
<LINE>Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats</LINE>

<LINE>The royal captain of this ruin'd band</LINE>
<LINE>Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,</LINE>
<LINE>Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'</LINE>
<LINE>For forth he goes and visits all his host.</LINE>
<LINE>Bids them good morrow with a modest smile</LINE>
<LINE>And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his royal face there is no note</LINE>
<LINE>How dread an army hath enrounded him;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the weary and all-watched night,</LINE>
<LINE>But freshly looks and over-bears attaint</LINE>
<LINE>With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;</LINE>
<LINE>That every wretch, pining and pale before,</LINE>

<LINE>A largess universal like the sun</LINE>
<LINE>His liberal eye doth give to every one,</LINE>
<LINE>Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,</LINE>
<LINE>Behold, as may unworthiness define,</LINE>
<LINE>A little touch of Harry in the night.</LINE>

<LINE>Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!</LINE>
<LINE>There is some soul of goodness in things evil,</LINE>
<LINE>Would men observingly distil it out.</LINE>
<LINE>For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is both healthful and good husbandry:</LINE>
<LINE>Besides, they are our outward consciences,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter three soldiers, JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT,
and MICHAEL WILLIAMS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>COURT</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which</LINE>
<LINE>breaks yonder?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it be: but we have no great cause to desire</LINE>
<LINE>the approach of day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think</LINE>
<LINE>we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A friend.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Under what captain serve you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I</LINE>
<LINE>pray you, what thinks he of our estate?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be</LINE>
<LINE>washed off the next tide.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He hath not told his thought to the king?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I</LINE>
<LINE>speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I</LINE>
<LINE>am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the</LINE>
<LINE>element shows to him as it doth to me; all his</LINE>
<LINE>senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies</LINE>
<LINE>laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and</LINE>
<LINE>though his affections are higher mounted than ours,</LINE>
<LINE>yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like</LINE>
<LINE>wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we</LINE>
<LINE>do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish</LINE>
<LINE>as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess</LINE>
<LINE>him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing</LINE>
<LINE>it, should dishearten his army.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He may show what outward courage he will; but I</LINE>
<LINE>believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish</LINE>
<LINE>himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he</LINE>
<LINE>were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:</LINE>
<LINE>I think he would not wish himself any where but</LINE>
<LINE>where he is.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then I would he were here alone; so should he be</LINE>
<LINE>sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here</LINE>
<LINE>alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's</LINE>
<LINE>minds: methinks I could not die any where so</LINE>
<LINE>contented as in the king's company; his cause being</LINE>
<LINE>just and his quarrel honourable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's more than we know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know</LINE>
<LINE>enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if</LINE>
<LINE>his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes</LINE>
<LINE>the crime of it out of us.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath</LINE>
<LINE>a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and</LINE>
<LINE>arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join</LINE>
<LINE>together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at</LINE>
<LINE>such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a</LINE>
<LINE>surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind</LINE>
<LINE>them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their</LINE>
<LINE>children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die</LINE>
<LINE>well that die in a battle; for how can they</LINE>
<LINE>charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their</LINE>
<LINE>argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it</LINE>
<LINE>will be a black matter for the king that led them to</LINE>
<LINE>it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of</LINE>
<LINE>subjection.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, if a son that is by his father sent about</LINE>
<LINE>merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the</LINE>
<LINE>imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be</LINE>
<LINE>imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a</LINE>
<LINE>servant, under his master's command transporting a</LINE>
<LINE>sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in</LINE>
<LINE>many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the</LINE>
<LINE>business of the master the author of the servant's</LINE>
<LINE>damnation: but this is not so: the king is not</LINE>
<LINE>bound to answer the particular endings of his</LINE>
<LINE>soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of</LINE>
<LINE>his servant; for they purpose not their death, when</LINE>
<LINE>they purpose their services. Besides, there is no</LINE>
<LINE>king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to</LINE>
<LINE>the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all</LINE>
<LINE>unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them</LINE>
<LINE>the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;</LINE>
<LINE>some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of</LINE>
<LINE>perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that</LINE>
<LINE>have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with</LINE>
<LINE>pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have</LINE>
<LINE>defeated the law and outrun native punishment,</LINE>
<LINE>though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to</LINE>
<LINE>fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;</LINE>
<LINE>so that here men are punished for before-breach of</LINE>
<LINE>the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where</LINE>
<LINE>they feared the death, they have borne life away;</LINE>
<LINE>and where they would be safe, they perish: then if</LINE>
<LINE>they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of</LINE>
<LINE>their damnation than he was before guilty of those</LINE>
<LINE>impieties for the which they are now visited. Every</LINE>
<LINE>subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's</LINE>
<LINE>soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in</LINE>
<LINE>the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every</LINE>
<LINE>mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death</LINE>
<LINE>is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was</LINE>
<LINE>blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:</LINE>
<LINE>and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think</LINE>
<LINE>that, making God so free an offer, He let him</LINE>
<LINE>outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach</LINE>
<LINE>others how they should prepare.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon</LINE>
<LINE>his own head, the king is not to answer it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I do not desire he should answer for me; and</LINE>
<LINE>yet I determine to fight lustily for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but</LINE>
<LINE>when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we</LINE>
<LINE>ne'er the wiser.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an</LINE>
<LINE>elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can</LINE>
<LINE>do against a monarch! you may as well go about to</LINE>
<LINE>turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a</LINE>
<LINE>peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word</LINE>
<LINE>after! come, 'tis a foolish saying.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your reproof is something too round: I should be</LINE>
<LINE>angry with you, if the time were convenient.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I embrace it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How shall I know thee again?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my</LINE>
<LINE>bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I</LINE>
<LINE>will make it my quarrel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's my glove: give me another of thine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come</LINE>
<LINE>to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'</LINE>
<LINE>by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou darest as well be hanged.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well. I will do it, though I take thee in the</LINE>
<LINE>king's company.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAMS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Keep thy word: fare thee well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BATES</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have</LINE>
<LINE>French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to</LINE>
<LINE>one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their</LINE>
<LINE>shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut</LINE>
<LINE>French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will</LINE>
<LINE>be a clipper.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exeunt soldiers</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,</LINE>
<LINE>Our debts, our careful wives,</LINE>
<LINE>Our children and our sins lay on the king!</LINE>
<LINE>We must bear all. O hard condition,</LINE>
<LINE>Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath</LINE>
<LINE>Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel</LINE>
<LINE>But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease</LINE>
<LINE>Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!</LINE>
<LINE>And what have kings, that privates have not too,</LINE>
<LINE>Save ceremony, save general ceremony?</LINE>
<LINE>And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?</LINE>
<LINE>What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more</LINE>
<LINE>Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?</LINE>
<LINE>What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?</LINE>
<LINE>O ceremony, show me but thy worth!</LINE>
<LINE>What is thy soul of adoration?</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,</LINE>
<LINE>Creating awe and fear in other men?</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd</LINE>
<LINE>Than they in fearing.</LINE>
<LINE>What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,</LINE>
<LINE>But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,</LINE>
<LINE>And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!</LINE>
<LINE>Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out</LINE>
<LINE>With titles blown from adulation?</LINE>
<LINE>Will it give place to flexure and low bending?</LINE>
<LINE>Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,</LINE>
<LINE>Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,</LINE>
<LINE>That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;</LINE>
<LINE>I am a king that find thee, and I know</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,</LINE>
<LINE>The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,</LINE>
<LINE>The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,</LINE>
<LINE>The farced title running 'fore the king,</LINE>
<LINE>The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp</LINE>
<LINE>That beats upon the high shore of this world,</LINE>
<LINE>No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,</LINE>
<LINE>Not all these, laid in bed majestical,</LINE>
<LINE>Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,</LINE>
<LINE>Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind</LINE>
<LINE>Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;</LINE>
<LINE>Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>But, like a lackey, from the rise to set</LINE>
<LINE>Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night</LINE>
<LINE>Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,</LINE>
<LINE>Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,</LINE>
<LINE>And follows so the ever-running year,</LINE>
<LINE>With profitable labour, to his grave:</LINE>
<LINE>And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,</LINE>
<LINE>Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.</LINE>
<LINE>The slave, a member of the country's peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots</LINE>
<LINE>What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose hours the peasant best advantages.</LINE>

<LINE>With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jades</LINE>
<LINE>Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,</LINE>
<LINE>The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes</LINE>

<LINE>And their executors, the knavish crows,</LINE>
<LINE>Fly o'er them, all impatient for their hour.</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's he that wishes so?</LINE>
<LINE>My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:</LINE>
<LINE>If we are mark'd to die, we are enow</LINE>
<LINE>To do our country loss; and if to live,</LINE>
<LINE>The fewer men, the greater share of honour.</LINE>
<LINE>God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.</LINE>
<LINE>By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;</LINE>
<LINE>It yearns me not if men my garments wear;</LINE>
<LINE>Such outward things dwell not in my desires:</LINE>
<LINE>But if it be a sin to covet honour,</LINE>
<LINE>I am the most offending soul alive.</LINE>
<LINE>No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:</LINE>
<LINE>God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour</LINE>
<LINE>As one man more, methinks, would share from me</LINE>
<LINE>For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!</LINE>
<LINE>Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,</LINE>
<LINE>That he which hath no stomach to this fight,</LINE>
<LINE>Let him depart; his passport shall be made</LINE>
<LINE>And crowns for convoy put into his purse:</LINE>
<LINE>We would not die in that man's company</LINE>
<LINE>That fears his fellowship to die with us.</LINE>
<LINE>This day is called the feast of Crispian:</LINE>
<LINE>He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,</LINE>
<LINE>Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,</LINE>
<LINE>And rouse him at the name of Crispian.</LINE>
<LINE>He that shall live this day, and see old age,</LINE>
<LINE>Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,</LINE>
<LINE>And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'</LINE>
<LINE>Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.</LINE>
<LINE>And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'</LINE>
<LINE>Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,</LINE>
<LINE>But he'll remember with advantages</LINE>
<LINE>What feats he did that day: then shall our names.</LINE>
<LINE>Familiar in his mouth as household words</LINE>
<LINE>Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,</LINE>
<LINE>Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,</LINE>
<LINE>Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.</LINE>
<LINE>This story shall the good man teach his son;</LINE>
<LINE>And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,</LINE>
<LINE>From this day to the ending of the world,</LINE>
<LINE>But we in it shall be remember'd;</LINE>
<LINE>We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;</LINE>
<LINE>For he to-day that sheds his blood with me</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,</LINE>
<LINE>This day shall gentle his condition:</LINE>
<LINE>And gentlemen in England now a-bed</LINE>

<LINE>While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.</LINE>
<LINE>A many of our bodies shall no doubt</LINE>
<LINE>Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:</LINE>
<LINE>And those that leave their valiant bones in France,</LINE>
<LINE>Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,</LINE>
<LINE>They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,</LINE>
<LINE>And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;</LINE>
<LINE>Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,</LINE>
<LINE>The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.</LINE>
<LINE>Mark then abounding valour in our English,</LINE>
<LINE>That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,</LINE>
<LINE>Break out into a second course of mischief,</LINE>
<LINE>Killing in relapse of mortality.</LINE>
<LINE>Let me speak proudly: tell the constable</LINE>
<LINE>We are but warriors for the working-day;</LINE>

<LINE>With rainy marching in the painful field;</LINE>
<LINE>There's not a piece of feather in our host--</LINE>
<LINE>Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--</LINE>
<LINE>And time hath worn us into slovenry:</LINE>
<LINE>But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;</LINE>
<LINE>And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night</LINE>
<LINE>They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck</LINE>
<LINE>The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads</LINE>
<LINE>And turn them out of service. If they do this,--</LINE>
<LINE>As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then</LINE>
<LINE>Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;</LINE>
<LINE>Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:</LINE>
<LINE>They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;</LINE>
<LINE>Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall yield them little, tell the constable.</LINE>

<LINE>The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.</LINE>
<LINE>Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,</LINE>
<LINE>Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes</LINE>
<LINE>That bloodily did spawn upon his face;</LINE>
<LINE>And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!</LINE>
<LINE>My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;</LINE>
<LINE>Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,</LINE>
<LINE>As in this glorious and well-foughten field</LINE>
<LINE>We kept together in our chivalry!'</LINE>
<LINE>Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:</LINE>
<LINE>He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,</LINE>
<LINE>And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Commend my service to me sovereign.'</LINE>
<LINE>So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck</LINE>
<LINE>He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;</LINE>
<LINE>And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd</LINE>
<LINE>A testament of noble-ending love.</LINE>
<LINE>The pretty and sweet manner of it forced</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the</LINE>

<LINE>magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase</LINE>
<LINE>is a little variations.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GOWER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his</LINE>
<LINE>father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FLUELLEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I</LINE>
<LINE>tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the</LINE>
<LINE>'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons</LINE>
<LINE>between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,</LINE>
<LINE>look you, is both alike. There is a river in</LINE>
<LINE>Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at</LINE>
<LINE>Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is</LINE>
<LINE>out of my prains what is the name of the other</LINE>
<LINE>river; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers is</LINE>
<LINE>to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you</LINE>
<LINE>mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life</LINE>
<LINE>is come after it indifferent well; for there is</LINE>
<LINE>figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and</LINE>
<LINE>you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his</LINE>
<LINE>wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his</LINE>
<LINE>displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a</LINE>
<LINE>little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and</LINE>
<LINE>his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.</LINE>

<LINE>It is not well done, mark you now take the tales out</LINE>

<LINE>but in the figures and comparisons of it: as</LINE>
<LINE>Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his</LINE>
<LINE>ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in</LINE>
<LINE>his right wits and his good judgments, turned away</LINE>
<LINE>the fat knight with the great belly-doublet: he</LINE>

<LINE>Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen,</LINE>
<LINE>Heave him away upon your winged thoughts</LINE>

<LINE>Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,</LINE>
<LINE>Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king</LINE>

<LINE>So swift a pace hath thought that even now</LINE>
<LINE>You may imagine him upon Blackheath;</LINE>
<LINE>Where that his lords desire him to have borne</LINE>
<LINE>His bruised helmet and his bended sword</LINE>
<LINE>Before him through the city: he forbids it,</LINE>
<LINE>Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;</LINE>
<LINE>Giving full trophy, signal and ostent</LINE>
<LINE>Quite from himself to God. But now behold,</LINE>

<LINE>Were now the general of our gracious empress,</LINE>
<LINE>As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,</LINE>
<LINE>Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,</LINE>
<LINE>How many would the peaceful city quit,</LINE>
<LINE>To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,</LINE>
<LINE>Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;</LINE>
<LINE>As yet the lamentation of the French</LINE>

<LINE>The emperor's coming in behalf of France,</LINE>
<LINE>To order peace between them; and omit</LINE>
<LINE>All the occurrences, whatever chanced,</LINE>
<LINE>Till Harry's back-return again to France:</LINE>

<LINE>Unto this bar and royal interview,</LINE>
<LINE>Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.</LINE>
<LINE>Since then my office hath so far prevail'd</LINE>
<LINE>That, face to face and royal eye to eye,</LINE>
<LINE>You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,</LINE>
<LINE>If I demand, before this royal view,</LINE>
<LINE>What rub or what impediment there is,</LINE>
<LINE>Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,</LINE>
<LINE>Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,</LINE>
<LINE>Should not in this best garden of the world</LINE>
<LINE>Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,</LINE>
<LINE>And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,</LINE>
<LINE>Corrupting in its own fertility.</LINE>
<LINE>Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd,</LINE>
<LINE>Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,</LINE>
<LINE>Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leas</LINE>
<LINE>The darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory</LINE>
<LINE>Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts</LINE>
<LINE>That should deracinate such savagery;</LINE>
<LINE>The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth</LINE>
<LINE>The freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,</LINE>
<LINE>Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,</LINE>
<LINE>Conceives by idleness and nothing teems</LINE>
<LINE>But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,</LINE>
<LINE>Losing both beauty and utility.</LINE>
<LINE>And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,</LINE>
<LINE>Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,</LINE>
<LINE>Even so our houses and ourselves and children</LINE>
<LINE>Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,</LINE>
<LINE>The sciences that should become our country;</LINE>
<LINE>But grow like savages,--as soldiers will</LINE>
<LINE>That nothing do but meditate on blood,--</LINE>
<LINE>To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire</LINE>
<LINE>And every thing that seems unnatural.</LINE>
<LINE>Which to reduce into our former favour</LINE>
<LINE>You are assembled: and my speech entreats</LINE>

<LINE>crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but</LINE>

<LINE>have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable</LINE>
<LINE>measure in strength. If I could win a lady at</LINE>
<LINE>leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my</LINE>
<LINE>armour on my back, under the correction of bragging</LINE>
<LINE>be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.</LINE>
<LINE>Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse</LINE>
<LINE>for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and</LINE>
<LINE>sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,</LINE>
<LINE>Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my</LINE>
<LINE>eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;</LINE>
<LINE>only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,</LINE>
<LINE>nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a</LINE>
<LINE>fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth</LINE>
<LINE>sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love</LINE>
<LINE>of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy</LINE>
<LINE>cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst</LINE>
<LINE>love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee</LINE>
<LINE>that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the</LINE>
<LINE>Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou</LINE>
<LINE>livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and</LINE>
<LINE>uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee</LINE>
<LINE>right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other</LINE>
<LINE>places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that</LINE>
<LINE>can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do</LINE>
<LINE>always reason themselves out again. What! a</LINE>
<LINE>speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A</LINE>
<LINE>good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a</LINE>
<LINE>black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow</LINE>
<LINE>bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax</LINE>
<LINE>hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the</LINE>
<LINE>moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it</LINE>
<LINE>shines bright and never changes, but keeps his</LINE>
<LINE>course truly. If thou would have such a one, take</LINE>
<LINE>me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,</LINE>
<LINE>take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?</LINE>
<LINE>speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of</LINE>
<LINE>France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love</LINE>
<LINE>the friend of France; for I love France so well that</LINE>
<LINE>I will not part with a village of it; I will have it</LINE>
<LINE>all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am</LINE>
<LINE>yours, then yours is France and you are mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell vat is dat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am</LINE>
<LINE>sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married</LINE>
<LINE>wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook</LINE>
<LINE>off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand</LINE>
<LINE>vous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what</LINE>
<LINE>then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est</LINE>
<LINE>France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,</LINE>
<LINE>Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much</LINE>
<LINE>more French: I shall never move thee in French,</LINE>
<LINE>unless it be to laugh at me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il</LINE>
<LINE>est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my</LINE>
<LINE>tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs</LINE>
<LINE>be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou</LINE>
<LINE>understand thus much English, canst thou love me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I cannot tell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask</LINE>
<LINE>them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,</LINE>
<LINE>when you come into your closet, you'll question this</LINE>
<LINE>gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to</LINE>
<LINE>her dispraise those parts in me that you love with</LINE>
<LINE>your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the</LINE>
<LINE>rather, gentle princess, because I love thee</LINE>
<LINE>cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a</LINE>
<LINE>saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get</LINE>
<LINE>thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs</LINE>
<LINE>prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,</LINE>
<LINE>between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a</LINE>
<LINE>boy, half French, half English, that shall go to</LINE>
<LINE>Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?</LINE>
<LINE>shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair</LINE>
<LINE>flower-de-luce?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I do not know dat</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do</LINE>
<LINE>but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your</LINE>
<LINE>French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety</LINE>
<LINE>take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer</LINE>
<LINE>you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher</LINE>
<LINE>et devin deesse?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de</LINE>
<LINE>most sage demoiselle dat is en France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in</LINE>
<LINE>true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I</LINE>
<LINE>dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to</LINE>
<LINE>flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor</LINE>
<LINE>and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew</LINE>
<LINE>my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars</LINE>
<LINE>when he got me: therefore was I created with a</LINE>
<LINE>stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when</LINE>
<LINE>I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,</LINE>
<LINE>Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:</LINE>
<LINE>my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of</LINE>
<LINE>beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou</LINE>
<LINE>hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou</LINE>
<LINE>shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:</LINE>
<LINE>and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you</LINE>
<LINE>have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the</LINE>
<LINE>thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;</LINE>
<LINE>take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am</LINE>
<LINE>thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine</LINE>
<LINE>ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is</LINE>
<LINE>thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry</LINE>
<LINE>Plantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before</LINE>
<LINE>his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,</LINE>
<LINE>thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is</LINE>
<LINE>music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of</LINE>
<LINE>all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken</LINE>
<LINE>English; wilt thou have me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, it will please him well, Kate it shall please</LINE>
<LINE>him, Kate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Den it sall also content me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi, je</LINE>
<LINE>ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en</LINE>
<LINE>baisant la main d'une de votre seigeurie indigne</LINE>
<LINE>serviteur; excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon</LINE>
<LINE>tres-puissant seigneur.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KATHARINE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant</LINE>
<LINE>leur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.</LINE>

<LINE>Madam my interpreter, what says she?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of</LINE>

<LINE>To kiss.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss</LINE>
<LINE>before they are married, would she say?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALICE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oui, vraiment.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear</LINE>
<LINE>Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak</LINE>
<LINE>list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of</LINE>
<LINE>manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our</LINE>
<LINE>places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will</LINE>
<LINE>do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your</LINE>
<LINE>country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently</LINE>
<LINE>and yielding.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Kissing her</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is</LINE>
<LINE>more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the</LINE>
<LINE>tongues of the French council; and they should</LINE>
<LINE>sooner persuade Harry of England than a general</LINE>
<LINE>petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY,
and other Lords</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach you</LINE>
<LINE>our princess English?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how</LINE>
<LINE>perfectly I love her; and that is good English.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is she not apt?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not</LINE>
<LINE>smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the</LINE>
<LINE>heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up</LINE>
<LINE>the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in</LINE>
<LINE>his true likeness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you</LINE>
<LINE>for that. If you would conjure in her, you must</LINE>
<LINE>make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true</LINE>
<LINE>likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you</LINE>
<LINE>blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the</LINE>
<LINE>virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the</LINE>
<LINE>appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing</LINE>
<LINE>self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid</LINE>
<LINE>to consign to.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They are then excused, my lord, when they see not</LINE>
<LINE>what they do.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will</LINE>
<LINE>teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well</LINE>
<LINE>summered and warm kept, are like flies at</LINE>
<LINE>Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their</LINE>
<LINE>eyes; and then they will endure handling, which</LINE>
<LINE>before would not abide looking on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer;</LINE>
<LINE>and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the</LINE>
<LINE>latter end and she must be blind too.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BURGUNDY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As love is, my lord, before it loves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love for</LINE>
<LINE>my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city</LINE>
<LINE>for one fair French maid that stands in my way.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRENCH KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities</LINE>
<LINE>turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with</LINE>
<LINE>maiden walls that war hath never entered.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shall Kate be my wife?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRENCH KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am content; so the maiden cities you talk of may</LINE>
<LINE>wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for</LINE>
<LINE>my wish shall show me the way to my will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRENCH KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We have consented to all terms of reason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is't so, my lords of England?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WESTMORELAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The king hath granted every article:</LINE>
<LINE>His daughter first, and then in sequel all,</LINE>
<LINE>According to their firm proposed natures.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EXETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Only he hath not yet subscribed this:</LINE>
<LINE>Where your majesty demands, that the King of France,</LINE>
<LINE>having any occasion to write for matter of grant,</LINE>
<LINE>shall name your highness in this form and with this</LINE>
<LINE>addition in French, Notre trescher fils Henri, Roi</LINE>
<LINE>d'Angleterre, Heritier de France; and thus in</LINE>
<LINE>Latin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex</LINE>
<LINE>Angliae, et Haeres Franciae.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRENCH KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,</LINE>
<LINE>But your request shall make me let it pass.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY V</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,</LINE>
<LINE>Let that one article rank with the rest;</LINE>
<LINE>And thereupon give me your daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>FRENCH KING</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up</LINE>
<LINE>Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms</LINE>
<LINE>Of France and England, whose very shores look pale</LINE>
<LINE>With envy of each other's happiness,</LINE>
<LINE>May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction</LINE>
<LINE>Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord</LINE>
<LINE>In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance</LINE>
<LINE>His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>
