<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As by your high imperial majesty</LINE>
<LINE>I had in charge at my depart for France,</LINE>
<LINE>As procurator to your excellence,</LINE>
<LINE>To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,</LINE>
<LINE>So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,</LINE>
<LINE>In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,</LINE>
<LINE>The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,</LINE>
<LINE>Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,</LINE>
<LINE>I have perform'd my task and was espoused:</LINE>
<LINE>And humbly now upon my bended knee,</LINE>
<LINE>In sight of England and her lordly peers,</LINE>
<LINE>Deliver up my title in the queen</LINE>
<LINE>To your most gracious hands, that are the substance</LINE>
<LINE>Of that great shadow I did represent;</LINE>
<LINE>The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,</LINE>
<LINE>The fairest queen that ever king received.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:</LINE>
<LINE>I can express no kinder sign of love</LINE>
<LINE>Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,</LINE>
<LINE>Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!</LINE>
<LINE>For thou hast given me in this beauteous face</LINE>
<LINE>A world of earthly blessings to my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great King of England and my gracious lord,</LINE>
<LINE>The mutual conference that my mind hath had,</LINE>
<LINE>By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,</LINE>
<LINE>In courtly company or at my beads,</LINE>

<LINE>Uncle, how now!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pardon me, gracious lord;</LINE>
<LINE>Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart</LINE>
<LINE>And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.</LINE>

<LINE>They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down:</LINE>

<LINE>We here discharge your grace from being regent</LINE>
<LINE>I' the parts of France, till term of eighteen months</LINE>

<LINE>Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,</LINE>
<LINE>Salisbury, and Warwick;</LINE>
<LINE>We thank you all for the great favour done,</LINE>
<LINE>In entertainment to my princely queen.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, let us in, and with all speed provide</LINE>
<LINE>To see her coronation be perform'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and SUFFOLK</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,</LINE>
<LINE>To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,</LINE>
<LINE>Your grief, the common grief of all the land.</LINE>
<LINE>What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,</LINE>
<LINE>His valour, coin and people, in the wars?</LINE>
<LINE>Did he so often lodge in open field,</LINE>
<LINE>In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,</LINE>
<LINE>To conquer France, his true inheritance?</LINE>
<LINE>And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep by policy what Henry got?</LINE>
<LINE>Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,</LINE>
<LINE>Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,</LINE>
<LINE>Received deep scars in France and Normandy?</LINE>
<LINE>Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,</LINE>
<LINE>With all the learned council of the realm,</LINE>
<LINE>Studied so long, sat in the council-house</LINE>
<LINE>Early and late, debating to and fro</LINE>
<LINE>How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,</LINE>
<LINE>And had his highness in his infancy</LINE>
<LINE>Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?</LINE>
<LINE>And shall these labours and these honours die?</LINE>
<LINE>Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,</LINE>
<LINE>Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?</LINE>
<LINE>O peers of England, shameful is this league!</LINE>
<LINE>Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,</LINE>
<LINE>Blotting your names from books of memory,</LINE>
<LINE>Razing the characters of your renown,</LINE>
<LINE>Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,</LINE>
<LINE>Undoing all, as all had never been!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,</LINE>
<LINE>This peroration with such circumstance?</LINE>
<LINE>For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;</LINE>
<LINE>But now it is impossible we should:</LINE>
<LINE>Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style</LINE>
<LINE>Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by the death of Him that died for all,</LINE>
<LINE>These counties were the keys of Normandy.</LINE>
<LINE>But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For grief that they are past recovery:</LINE>
<LINE>For, were there hope to conquer them again,</LINE>
<LINE>My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.</LINE>
<LINE>Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;</LINE>
<LINE>Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:</LINE>
<LINE>And are the cities, that I got with wounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Delivered up again with peaceful words?</LINE>
<LINE>Mort Dieu!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,</LINE>
<LINE>That dims the honour of this warlike isle!</LINE>
<LINE>France should have torn and rent my very heart,</LINE>
<LINE>Before I would have yielded to this league.</LINE>
<LINE>I never read but England's kings have had</LINE>
<LINE>Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:</LINE>
<LINE>And our King Henry gives away his own,</LINE>
<LINE>To match with her that brings no vantages.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A proper jest, and never heard before,</LINE>
<LINE>That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth</LINE>
<LINE>For costs and charges in transporting her!</LINE>
<LINE>She should have stayed in France and starved</LINE>
<LINE>in France, Before--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:</LINE>
<LINE>It was the pleasure of my lord the King.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,</LINE>
<LINE>But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.</LINE>
<LINE>Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face</LINE>
<LINE>I see thy fury: if I longer stay,</LINE>
<LINE>We shall begin our ancient bickerings.</LINE>
<LINE>Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,</LINE>
<LINE>I prophesied France will be lost ere long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, there goes our protector in a rage.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,</LINE>
<LINE>And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.</LINE>
<LINE>Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>And heir apparent to the English crown:</LINE>
<LINE>Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,</LINE>
<LINE>And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,</LINE>
<LINE>There's reason he should be displeased at it.</LINE>
<LINE>Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words</LINE>
<LINE>Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.</LINE>
<LINE>What though the common people favour him,</LINE>
<LINE>Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of</LINE>
<LINE>Gloucester,'</LINE>
<LINE>Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,</LINE>
<LINE>'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'</LINE>
<LINE>With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'</LINE>
<LINE>I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,</LINE>
<LINE>He will be found a dangerous protector.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>He being of age to govern of himself?</LINE>
<LINE>Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,</LINE>
<LINE>And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This weighty business will not brook delay:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride</LINE>
<LINE>And greatness of his place be grief to us,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:</LINE>
<LINE>His insolence is more intolerable</LINE>
<LINE>Than all the princes in the land beside:</LINE>
<LINE>If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,</LINE>
<LINE>Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pride went before, ambition follows him.</LINE>
<LINE>While these do labour for their own preferment,</LINE>
<LINE>Behoves it us to labour for the realm.</LINE>
<LINE>I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester</LINE>
<LINE>Did bear him like a noble gentleman.</LINE>
<LINE>Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,</LINE>
<LINE>More like a soldier than a man o' the church,</LINE>
<LINE>As stout and proud as he were lord of all,</LINE>
<LINE>Swear like a ruffian and demean himself</LINE>
<LINE>Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.</LINE>
<LINE>Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,</LINE>
<LINE>Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:</LINE>
<LINE>And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,</LINE>
<LINE>In bringing them to civil discipline,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,</LINE>
<LINE>When thou wert regent for our sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:</LINE>
<LINE>Join we together, for the public good,</LINE>
<LINE>In what we can, to bridle and suppress</LINE>
<LINE>The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,</LINE>
<LINE>With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;</LINE>
<LINE>And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,</LINE>
<LINE>While they do tend the profit of the land.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,</LINE>
<LINE>And common profit of his country!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;</LINE>
<LINE>That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,</LINE>
<LINE>And would have kept so long as breath did last!</LINE>
<LINE>Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,</LINE>
<LINE>Which I will win from France, or else be slain,</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Anjou and Maine are given to the French;</LINE>
<LINE>Paris is lost; the state of Normandy</LINE>
<LINE>Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:</LINE>
<LINE>Suffolk concluded on the articles,</LINE>
<LINE>The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased</LINE>
<LINE>To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.</LINE>
<LINE>Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage</LINE>
<LINE>And purchase friends and give to courtezans,</LINE>
<LINE>Still revelling like lords till all be gone;</LINE>
<LINE>While as the silly owner of the goods</LINE>
<LINE>Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands</LINE>
<LINE>And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,</LINE>
<LINE>While all is shared and all is borne away,</LINE>
<LINE>Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:</LINE>
<LINE>So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland</LINE>
<LINE>Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood</LINE>
<LINE>As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.</LINE>
<LINE>Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!</LINE>
<LINE>Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,</LINE>
<LINE>Even as I have of fertile England's soil.</LINE>
<LINE>A day will come when York shall claim his own;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts</LINE>
<LINE>And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,</LINE>
<LINE>And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:</LINE>
<LINE>Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor wear the diadem upon his head,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:</LINE>
<LINE>Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,</LINE>
<LINE>To pry into the secrets of the state;</LINE>
<LINE>Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,</LINE>
<LINE>With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,</LINE>
<LINE>And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:</LINE>
<LINE>Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,</LINE>
<LINE>With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;</LINE>
<LINE>And in my standard bear the arms of York</LINE>
<LINE>To grapple with the house of Lancaster;</LINE>
<LINE>And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,</LINE>
<LINE>Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?</LINE>
<LINE>Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,</LINE>
<LINE>As frowning at the favours of the world?</LINE>
<LINE>Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,</LINE>
<LINE>Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?</LINE>
<LINE>What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,</LINE>
<LINE>Enchased with all the honours of the world?</LINE>
<LINE>If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,</LINE>
<LINE>Until thy head be circled with the same.</LINE>
<LINE>Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.</LINE>
<LINE>What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:</LINE>
<LINE>And, having both together heaved it up,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>And never more abase our sight so low</LINE>
<LINE>As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,</LINE>
<LINE>Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.</LINE>
<LINE>And may that thought, when I imagine ill</LINE>
<LINE>Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,</LINE>
<LINE>Be my last breathing in this mortal world!</LINE>
<LINE>My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it</LINE>
<LINE>With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,</LINE>
<LINE>Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,</LINE>
<LINE>But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;</LINE>
<LINE>And on the pieces of the broken wand</LINE>
<LINE>Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,</LINE>
<LINE>And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk.</LINE>
<LINE>This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, this was nothing but an argument</LINE>
<LINE>That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove</LINE>
<LINE>Shall lose his head for his presumption.</LINE>
<LINE>But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:</LINE>
<LINE>Methought I sat in seat of majesty</LINE>
<LINE>In the cathedral church of Westminster,</LINE>
<LINE>And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;</LINE>
<LINE>Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me</LINE>
<LINE>And on my head did set the diadem.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:</LINE>
<LINE>Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,</LINE>
<LINE>Art thou not second woman in the realm,</LINE>
<LINE>And the protector's wife, beloved of him?</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,</LINE>
<LINE>Above the reach or compass of thy thought?</LINE>
<LINE>And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,</LINE>
<LINE>To tumble down thy husband and thyself</LINE>
<LINE>From top of honour to disgrace's feet?</LINE>
<LINE>Away from me, and let me hear no more!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, what, my lord! are you so choleric</LINE>
<LINE>With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?</LINE>
<LINE>Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,</LINE>
<LINE>And not be cheque'd.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>DUCHESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HUME</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,</LINE>
<LINE>Your grace's title shall be multiplied.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What say'st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'd</LINE>
<LINE>With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,</LINE>
<LINE>With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?</LINE>
<LINE>And will they undertake to do me good?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HUME</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This they have promised, to show your highness</LINE>
<LINE>A spirit raised from depth of under-ground,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall make answer to such questions</LINE>
<LINE>As by your grace shall be propounded him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is enough; I'll think upon the questions:</LINE>
<LINE>When from St. Alban's we do make return,</LINE>
<LINE>We'll see these things effected to the full.</LINE>
<LINE>Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man,</LINE>
<LINE>With thy confederates in this weighty cause.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>HUME</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;</LINE>
<LINE>Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!</LINE>
<LINE>Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:</LINE>
<LINE>The business asketh silent secrecy.</LINE>
<LINE>Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:</LINE>
<LINE>Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet have I gold flies from another coast;</LINE>
<LINE>I dare not say, from the rich cardinal</LINE>
<LINE>And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet I do find it so; for to be plain,</LINE>
<LINE>They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,</LINE>
<LINE>Have hired me to undermine the duchess</LINE>
<LINE>And buz these conjurations in her brain.</LINE>
<LINE>They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'</LINE>
<LINE>Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.</LINE>
<LINE>Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near</LINE>
<LINE>To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last</LINE>
<LINE>Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,</LINE>
<LINE>And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall:</LINE>
<LINE>Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.</LINE>

<LINE>Here a' comes, methinks, and the queen with him.</LINE>
<LINE>I'll be the first, sure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Petitioner</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come back, fool; this is the Duke of Suffolk, and</LINE>
<LINE>not my lord protector.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How now, fellow! would'st anything with me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Petitioner</SPEAKER>

<LINE>Mine is, an't please your grace, against John</LINE>

<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What sayst thou? did the Duke of York say he was</LINE>
<LINE>rightful heir to the crown?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That my master was? no, forsooth: my master said</LINE>
<LINE>that he was, and that the king was an usurper.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,</LINE>
<LINE>Is this the fashion in the court of England?</LINE>
<LINE>Is this the government of Britain's isle,</LINE>
<LINE>And this the royalty of Albion's king?</LINE>
<LINE>What shall King Henry be a pupil still</LINE>
<LINE>Under the surly Gloucester's governance?</LINE>
<LINE>Am I a queen in title and in style,</LINE>
<LINE>And must be made a subject to a duke?</LINE>
<LINE>I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours</LINE>
<LINE>Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love</LINE>
<LINE>And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France,</LINE>
<LINE>I thought King Henry had resembled thee</LINE>
<LINE>In courage, courtship and proportion:</LINE>
<LINE>But all his mind is bent to holiness,</LINE>
<LINE>To number Ave-Maries on his beads;</LINE>
<LINE>His champions are the prophets and apostles,</LINE>
<LINE>His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,</LINE>
<LINE>His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves</LINE>
<LINE>Are brazen images of canonized saints.</LINE>
<LINE>I would the college of the cardinals</LINE>
<LINE>Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,</LINE>
<LINE>And set the triple crown upon his head:</LINE>
<LINE>That were a state fit for his holiness.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, be patient: as I was cause</LINE>
<LINE>Your highness came to England, so will I</LINE>
<LINE>In England work your grace's full content.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beside the haughty protector, have we Beaufort,</LINE>
<LINE>The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,</LINE>
<LINE>And grumbling York: and not the least of these</LINE>
<LINE>But can do more in England than the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And he of these that can do most of all</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:</LINE>
<LINE>Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not all these lords do vex me half so much</LINE>
<LINE>As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife.</LINE>
<LINE>She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,</LINE>
<LINE>More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife:</LINE>
<LINE>Strangers in court do take her for the queen:</LINE>
<LINE>She bears a duke's revenues on her back,</LINE>
<LINE>And in her heart she scorns our poverty:</LINE>
<LINE>Shall I not live to be avenged on her?</LINE>
<LINE>Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,</LINE>
<LINE>She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day,</LINE>
<LINE>The very train of her worst wearing gown</LINE>
<LINE>Was better worth than all my father's lands,</LINE>
<LINE>Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, myself have limed a bush for her,</LINE>
<LINE>And placed a quire of such enticing birds,</LINE>
<LINE>That she will light to listen to the lays,</LINE>
<LINE>And never mount to trouble you again.</LINE>
<LINE>So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me;</LINE>
<LINE>For I am bold to counsel you in this.</LINE>
<LINE>Although we fancy not the cardinal,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet must we join with him and with the lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.</LINE>
<LINE>As for the Duke of York, this late complaint</LINE>
<LINE>Will make but little for his benefit.</LINE>
<LINE>So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,</LINE>
<LINE>And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER,
CARDINAL, BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY,
WARWICK, and the DUCHESS</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For my part, noble lords, I care not which;</LINE>
<LINE>Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If York have ill demean'd himself in France,</LINE>
<LINE>Then let him be denay'd the regentship.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If Somerset be unworthy of the place,</LINE>
<LINE>Let York be regent; I will yield to him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,</LINE>
<LINE>Dispute not that: York is the worthier.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The cardinal's not my better in the field.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Warwick may live to be the best of all.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham,</LINE>
<LINE>Why Somerset should be preferred in this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, the king is old enough himself</LINE>
<LINE>To give his censure: these are no women's matters.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If he be old enough, what needs your grace</LINE>
<LINE>To be protector of his excellence?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, I am protector of the realm;</LINE>
<LINE>And, at his pleasure, will resign my place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Resign it then and leave thine insolence.</LINE>
<LINE>Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--</LINE>
<LINE>The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;</LINE>
<LINE>The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;</LINE>
<LINE>And all the peers and nobles of the realm</LINE>
<LINE>Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags</LINE>
<LINE>Are lank and lean with thy extortions.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire</LINE>
<LINE>Have cost a mass of public treasury.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy cruelty in execution</LINE>
<LINE>Upon offenders, hath exceeded law,</LINE>
<LINE>And left thee to the mercy of the law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They sale of offices and towns in France,</LINE>
<LINE>If they were known, as the suspect is great,</LINE>
<LINE>Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I cry you mercy, madam; was it you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Was't I! yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman:</LINE>
<LINE>Could I come near your beauty with my nails,</LINE>
<LINE>I'd set my ten commandments in your face.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Against her will! good king, look to't in time;</LINE>
<LINE>She'll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby:</LINE>
<LINE>Though in this place most master wear no breeches,</LINE>
<LINE>She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,</LINE>
<LINE>And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds:</LINE>
<LINE>She's tickled now; her fume needs no spurs,</LINE>
<LINE>She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter GLOUCESTER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, lords, my choler being over-blown</LINE>
<LINE>With walking once about the quadrangle,</LINE>
<LINE>I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.</LINE>
<LINE>As for your spiteful false objections,</LINE>
<LINE>Prove them, and I lie open to the law:</LINE>
<LINE>But God in mercy so deal with my soul,</LINE>
<LINE>As I in duty love my king and country!</LINE>
<LINE>But, to the matter that we have in hand:</LINE>
<LINE>I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man</LINE>
<LINE>To be your regent in the realm of France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Before we make election, give me leave</LINE>
<LINE>To show some reason, of no little force,</LINE>
<LINE>That York is most unmeet of any man.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:</LINE>
<LINE>First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;</LINE>
<LINE>Next, if I be appointed for the place,</LINE>
<LINE>My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,</LINE>
<LINE>Without discharge, money, or furniture,</LINE>
<LINE>Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands:</LINE>
<LINE>Last time, I danced attendance on his will</LINE>
<LINE>Till Paris was besieged, famish'd, and lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That can I witness; and a fouler fact</LINE>
<LINE>Did never traitor in the land commit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace, headstrong Warwick!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man
PETER, guarded</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Because here is a man accused of treason:</LINE>
<LINE>Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What mean'st thou, Suffolk; tell me, what are these?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Please it your majesty, this is the man</LINE>
<LINE>That doth accuse his master of high treason:</LINE>
<LINE>His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,</LINE>
<LINE>Was rightful heir unto the English crown</LINE>
<LINE>And that your majesty was a usurper.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say, man, were these thy words?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORNER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>An't shall please your majesty, I never said nor</LINE>
<LINE>thought any such matter: God is my witness, I am</LINE>
<LINE>falsely accused by the villain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to</LINE>
<LINE>me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my</LINE>
<LINE>Lord of York's armour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Base dunghill villain and mechanical,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.</LINE>
<LINE>I do beseech your royal majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>Let him have all the rigor of the law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORNER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words.</LINE>
<LINE>My accuser is my 'prentice; and when I did correct</LINE>
<LINE>him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his</LINE>
<LINE>knees he would be even with me: I have good</LINE>
<LINE>witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>do not cast away an honest man for a villain's</LINE>
<LINE>accusation.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This doom, my lord, if I may judge:</LINE>
<LINE>Let Somerset be regent over the French,</LINE>
<LINE>Because in York this breeds suspicion:</LINE>
<LINE>And let these have a day appointed them</LINE>
<LINE>For single combat in convenient place,</LINE>
<LINE>For he hath witness of his servant's malice:</LINE>
<LINE>This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I humbly thank your royal majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HORNER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I accept the combat willingly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>PETER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity</LINE>
<LINE>my case. The spite of man prevaileth against me. O</LINE>
<LINE>Lord, have mercy upon me! I shall never be able to</LINE>
<LINE>fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, or you must fight, or else be hang'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away with them to prison; and the day of combat</LINE>
<LINE>shall be the last of the next month. Come,</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOLINGBROKE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:</LINE>
<LINE>Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,</LINE>
<LINE>The time of night when Troy was set on fire;</LINE>
<LINE>The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,</LINE>
<LINE>And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves,</LINE>
<LINE>That time best fits the work we have in hand.</LINE>
<LINE>Madam, sit you and fear not: whom we raise,</LINE>
<LINE>We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.</LINE>

<LINE>Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well:</LINE>

<LINE>Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.</LINE>
<LINE>What have we here?</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Reads</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>'The duke yet lives, that Henry shall depose;</LINE>
<LINE>But him outlive, and die a violent death.'</LINE>
<LINE>Why, this is just</LINE>
<LINE>'Aio te, AEacida, Romanos vincere posse.'</LINE>
<LINE>Well, to the rest:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?</LINE>
<LINE>By water shall he die, and take his end.</LINE>
<LINE>What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?</LINE>
<LINE>Let him shun castles;</LINE>
<LINE>Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains</LINE>
<LINE>Than where castles mounted stand.'</LINE>
<LINE>Come, come, my lords;</LINE>
<LINE>These oracles are hardly attain'd,</LINE>
<LINE>And hardly understood.</LINE>
<LINE>The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's,</LINE>
<LINE>With him the husband of this lovely lady:</LINE>
<LINE>Thither go these news, as fast as horse can</LINE>
<LINE>carry them:</LINE>
<LINE>A sorry breakfast for my lord protector.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,</LINE>
<LINE>I saw not better sport these seven years' day:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high;</LINE>
<LINE>And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,</LINE>
<LINE>And what a pitch she flew above the rest!</LINE>
<LINE>To see how God in all his creatures works!</LINE>
<LINE>Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No marvel, an it like your majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>My lord protector's hawks do tower so well;</LINE>
<LINE>They know their master loves to be aloft,</LINE>
<LINE>And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind</LINE>
<LINE>That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?</LINE>
<LINE>Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?</LINE>

<LINE>With such holiness can you do it?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No malice, sir; no more than well becomes</LINE>
<LINE>So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.</LINE>

<LINE>Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,</LINE>
<LINE>We had had more sport.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Aside to GLOUCESTER</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Come with thy two-hand sword.</LINE>

<LINE>Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,</LINE>
<LINE>That we for thee may glorify the Lord.</LINE>
<LINE>What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Born blind, an't please your grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Wife</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, indeed, was he.</LINE>

<LINE>Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance,</LINE>
<LINE>Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd</LINE>
<LINE>A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,</LINE>
<LINE>By good Saint Alban; who said, 'Simpcox, come,</LINE>
<LINE>Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Wife</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft</LINE>
<LINE>Myself have heard a voice to call him so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, art thou lame?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, God Almighty help me!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How camest thou so?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A fall off of a tree.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Wife</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A plum-tree, master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How long hast thou been blind?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Born so, master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, and wouldst climb a tree?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But that in all my life, when I was a youth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Wife</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst</LINE>
<LINE>venture so.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons,</LINE>
<LINE>And made me climb, with danger of my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.</LINE>
<LINE>Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them:</LINE>
<LINE>In my opinion yet thou seest not well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and</LINE>
<LINE>Saint Alban.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Red, master; red as blood.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And yet, I think, jet did he never see.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Wife</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Never, before this day, in all his life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, master, I know not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's his name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I know not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor his?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, indeed, master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What's thine own name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in</LINE>
<LINE>Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou</LINE>
<LINE>mightest as well have known all our names as thus to</LINE>
<LINE>name the several colours we do wear. Sight may</LINE>
<LINE>distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them</LINE>
<LINE>all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here</LINE>
<LINE>hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his</LINE>
<LINE>cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple</LINE>
<LINE>to his legs again?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O master, that you could!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My masters of Saint Alban's, have you not beadles in</LINE>
<LINE>your town, and things called whips?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mayor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, my lord, if it please your grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then send for one presently.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Mayor</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit an Attendant</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now, sirrah,</LINE>
<LINE>if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me</LINE>
<LINE>over this stool and run away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone:</LINE>
<LINE>You go about to torture me in vain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter a Beadle with whips</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, sir, we must have you find your legs. Sirrah</LINE>
<LINE>beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Beadle</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah; off with your</LINE>
<LINE>doublet quickly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIMPCOX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over
the stool and runs away; and they follow and cry, 'A miracle!'</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It made me laugh to see the villain run.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Follow the knave; and take this drab away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Wife</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Let them be whipped through every market-town, till</LINE>
<LINE>they come to Berwick, from whence they came.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Wife, Beadle, Mayor, &amp;c</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True; made the lame to leap and fly away.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But you have done more miracles than I;</LINE>
<LINE>You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter BUCKINGHAM</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.</LINE>
<LINE>A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the countenance and confederacy</LINE>
<LINE>Of Lady Eleanor, the protector's wife,</LINE>
<LINE>The ringleader and head of all this rout,</LINE>
<LINE>Have practised dangerously against your state,</LINE>
<LINE>Dealing with witches and with conjurers:</LINE>
<LINE>Whom we have apprehended in the fact;</LINE>
<LINE>Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,</LINE>
<LINE>Demanding of King Henry's life and death,</LINE>
<LINE>And other of your highness' privy-council;</LINE>
<LINE>As more at large your grace shall understand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside to GLOUCESTER</STAGEDIR>  And so, my lord protector,</LINE>
<LINE>by this means</LINE>
<LINE>Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.</LINE>
<LINE>This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge;</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart:</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers;</LINE>
<LINE>And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to thee,</LINE>
<LINE>Or to the meanest groom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,</LINE>
<LINE>Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest.</LINE>
<LINE>And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,</LINE>
<LINE>How I have loved my king and commonweal:</LINE>
<LINE>And, for my wife, I know not how it stands;</LINE>
<LINE>Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:</LINE>
<LINE>Noble she is, but if she have forgot</LINE>
<LINE>Honour and virtue and conversed with such</LINE>
<LINE>As, like to pitch, defile nobility,</LINE>
<LINE>I banish her my bed and company</LINE>
<LINE>And give her as a prey to law and shame,</LINE>
<LINE>That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, for this night we will repose us here:</LINE>
<LINE>To-morrow toward London back again,</LINE>
<LINE>To look into this business thoroughly</LINE>
<LINE>And call these foul offenders to their answers</LINE>
<LINE>And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Flourish. Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  London. YORK'S garden.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,</LINE>
<LINE>Our simple supper ended, give me leave</LINE>
<LINE>In this close walk to satisfy myself,</LINE>
<LINE>In craving your opinion of my title,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is infallible, to England's crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I long to hear it at full.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,</LINE>
<LINE>The Nevils are thy subjects to command.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then thus:</LINE>
<LINE>Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:</LINE>
<LINE>The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;</LINE>
<LINE>The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,</LINE>
<LINE>Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom</LINE>
<LINE>Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;</LINE>
<LINE>The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;</LINE>
<LINE>The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;</LINE>
<LINE>William of Windsor was the seventh and last.</LINE>
<LINE>Edward the Black Prince died before his father</LINE>
<LINE>And left behind him Richard, his only son,</LINE>
<LINE>Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;</LINE>
<LINE>Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,</LINE>
<LINE>Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,</LINE>
<LINE>Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,</LINE>
<LINE>Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,</LINE>
<LINE>And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,</LINE>
<LINE>Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Father, the duke hath told the truth:</LINE>
<LINE>Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Which now they hold by force and not by right;</LINE>
<LINE>For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,</LINE>
<LINE>The issue of the next son should have reign'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But William of Hatfield died without an heir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line</LINE>
<LINE>I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:</LINE>
<LINE>Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;</LINE>
<LINE>Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,</LINE>
<LINE>As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;</LINE>
<LINE>And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,</LINE>
<LINE>Who kept him in captivity till he died.</LINE>
<LINE>But to the rest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>His eldest sister, Anne,</LINE>
<LINE>My mother, being heir unto the crown</LINE>
<LINE>Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son</LINE>
<LINE>To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.</LINE>
<LINE>By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir</LINE>
<LINE>To Roger Earl of March, who was the son</LINE>
<LINE>Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,</LINE>
<LINE>Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:</LINE>
<LINE>So, if the issue of the elder son</LINE>
<LINE>Succeed before the younger, I am king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What plain proceeding is more plain than this?</LINE>
<LINE>Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,</LINE>
<LINE>The fourth son; York claims it from the third.</LINE>
<LINE>Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:</LINE>
<LINE>It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee</LINE>
<LINE>And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.</LINE>
<LINE>Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;</LINE>
<LINE>And in this private plot be we the first</LINE>
<LINE>That shall salute our rightful sovereign</LINE>
<LINE>With honour of his birthright to the crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BOTH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We thank you, lords. But I am not your king</LINE>
<LINE>Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd</LINE>
<LINE>With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;</LINE>
<LINE>And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,</LINE>
<LINE>But with advice and silent secrecy.</LINE>
<LINE>Do you as I do in these dangerous days:</LINE>
<LINE>Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,</LINE>
<LINE>At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,</LINE>
<LINE>At Buckingham and all the crew of them,</LINE>
<LINE>Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,</LINE>
<LINE>That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that</LINE>
<LINE>Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick</LINE>
<LINE>Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:</LINE>
<LINE>Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick</LINE>
<LINE>The greatest man in England but the king.</LINE>

<LINE>Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife:</LINE>
<LINE>In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:</LINE>
<LINE>Receive the sentence of the law for sins</LINE>
<LINE>Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.</LINE>
<LINE>You four, from hence to prison back again;</LINE>
<LINE>From thence unto the place of execution:</LINE>
<LINE>The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,</LINE>
<LINE>And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.</LINE>
<LINE>You, madam, for you are more nobly born,</LINE>
<LINE>Despoiled of your honour in your life,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall, after three days' open penance done,</LINE>
<LINE>Live in your country here in banishment,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt DUCHESS and other prisoners, guarded</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age</LINE>
<LINE>Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!</LINE>
<LINE>I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go;</LINE>
<LINE>Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>

<LINE>My stay, my guide and lantern to my feet:</LINE>

<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see no reason why a king of years</LINE>

<LINE>God and King Henry govern England's realm.</LINE>
<LINE>Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My staff? here, noble Henry, is my staff:</LINE>
<LINE>As willingly do I the same resign</LINE>
<LINE>As e'er thy father Henry made it mine;</LINE>
<LINE>And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it</LINE>
<LINE>As others would ambitiously receive it.</LINE>
<LINE>Farewell, good king: when I am dead and gone,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, now is Henry king, and Margaret queen;</LINE>
<LINE>And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,</LINE>
<LINE>That bears so shrewd a maim; two pulls at once;</LINE>
<LINE>His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off.</LINE>
<LINE>This staff of honour raught, there let it stand</LINE>
<LINE>Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.</LINE>

<LINE>Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore</LINE>

<LINE>Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's</LINE>
<LINE>instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an</LINE>
<LINE>honest man: and touching the Duke of York, I will</LINE>
<LINE>take my death, I never meant him any ill, nor the</LINE>
<LINE>king, nor the queen: and therefore, Peter, have at</LINE>
<LINE>thee with a downright blow!</LINE>

<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Dispatch: this knave's tongue begins to double.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;</LINE>
<LINE>And after summer evermore succeeds</LINE>
<LINE>Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold:</LINE>
<LINE>So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.</LINE>
<LINE>Sirs, what's o'clock?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Servants</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ten, my lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ten is the hour that was appointed me</LINE>
<LINE>To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess:</LINE>
<LINE>Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,</LINE>
<LINE>To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.</LINE>
<LINE>Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook</LINE>
<LINE>The abject people gazing on thy face,</LINE>
<LINE>With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,</LINE>
<LINE>That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels</LINE>
<LINE>When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.</LINE>
<LINE>But, soft! I think she comes; and I'll prepare</LINE>
<LINE>My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet, and a taper
burning in her hand; with STANLEY, the Sheriff,
and Officers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Servant</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So please your grace, we'll take her from the sheriff.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, stir not, for your lives; let her pass by.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?</LINE>
<LINE>Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!</LINE>
<LINE>See how the giddy multitude do point,</LINE>
<LINE>And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,</LINE>
<LINE>And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,</LINE>
<LINE>And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!</LINE>
<LINE>For whilst I think I am thy married wife</LINE>
<LINE>And thou a prince, protector of this land,</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks I should not thus be led along,</LINE>
<LINE>Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,</LINE>
<LINE>And followed with a rabble that rejoice</LINE>
<LINE>To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.</LINE>
<LINE>The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,</LINE>
<LINE>And when I start, the envious people laugh</LINE>
<LINE>And bid me be advised how I tread.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?</LINE>
<LINE>Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,</LINE>
<LINE>Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?</LINE>
<LINE>No; dark shall be my light and night my day;</LINE>
<LINE>To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.</LINE>
<LINE>Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife,</LINE>
<LINE>And he a prince and ruler of the land:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was</LINE>
<LINE>As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,</LINE>
<LINE>Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock</LINE>
<LINE>To every idle rascal follower.</LINE>
<LINE>But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death</LINE>
<LINE>Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;</LINE>
<LINE>For Suffolk, he that can do all in all</LINE>
<LINE>With her that hateth thee and hates us all,</LINE>
<LINE>And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,</LINE>
<LINE>Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,</LINE>
<LINE>And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee:</LINE>
<LINE>But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry;</LINE>
<LINE>I must offend before I be attainted;</LINE>
<LINE>And had I twenty times so many foes,</LINE>
<LINE>And each of them had twenty times their power,</LINE>
<LINE>All these could not procure me any scathe,</LINE>
<LINE>So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless.</LINE>
<LINE>Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away</LINE>
<LINE>But I in danger for the breach of law.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell:</LINE>
<LINE>I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience;</LINE>
<LINE>These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.</LINE>

<LINE>Because I wish'd this world's eternity.</LINE>
<LINE>Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence;</LINE>
<LINE>I care not whither, for I beg no favour,</LINE>
<LINE>Only convey me where thou art commanded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>STANLEY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man;</LINE>
<LINE>There to be used according to your state.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DUCHESS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:</LINE>
<LINE>And shall I then be used reproachfully?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey's lady;</LINE>

SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,</LINE>
<LINE>Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Can you not see? or will ye not observe</LINE>
<LINE>The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?</LINE>
<LINE>With what a majesty he bears himself,</LINE>
<LINE>How insolent of late he is become,</LINE>
<LINE>How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?</LINE>
<LINE>We know the time since he was mild and affable,</LINE>
<LINE>And if we did but glance a far-off look,</LINE>
<LINE>Immediately he was upon his knee,</LINE>
<LINE>That all the court admired him for submission:</LINE>
<LINE>But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,</LINE>
<LINE>When every one will give the time of day,</LINE>
<LINE>He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,</LINE>
<LINE>And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,</LINE>
<LINE>Disdaining duty that to us belongs.</LINE>
<LINE>Small curs are not regarded when they grin;</LINE>
<LINE>But great men tremble when the lion roars;</LINE>
<LINE>And Humphrey is no little man in England.</LINE>
<LINE>First note that he is near you in descent,</LINE>
<LINE>And should you fall, he as the next will mount.</LINE>
<LINE>Me seemeth then it is no policy,</LINE>
<LINE>Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears</LINE>
<LINE>And his advantage following your decease,</LINE>
<LINE>That he should come about your royal person</LINE>
<LINE>Or be admitted to your highness' council.</LINE>
<LINE>By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,</LINE>
<LINE>And when he please to make commotion,</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.</LINE>
<LINE>Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;</LINE>
<LINE>Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden</LINE>
<LINE>And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.</LINE>
<LINE>The reverent care I bear unto my lord</LINE>
<LINE>Made me collect these dangers in the duke.</LINE>
<LINE>If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;</LINE>
<LINE>Which fear if better reasons can supplant,</LINE>
<LINE>I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.</LINE>
<LINE>My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,</LINE>
<LINE>Reprove my allegation, if you can;</LINE>
<LINE>Or else conclude my words effectual.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well hath your highness seen into this duke;</LINE>
<LINE>And, had I first been put to speak my mind,</LINE>
<LINE>I think I should have told your grace's tale.</LINE>
<LINE>The duchess, by his subornation,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon my life, began her devilish practises:</LINE>
<LINE>Or, if he were not privy to those faults,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, by reputing of his high descent,</LINE>
<LINE>As next the king he was successive heir,</LINE>
<LINE>And such high vaunts of his nobility,</LINE>
<LINE>Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess</LINE>
<LINE>By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.</LINE>
<LINE>Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;</LINE>
<LINE>And in his simple show he harbours treason.</LINE>
<LINE>The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.</LINE>
<LINE>No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man</LINE>
<LINE>Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Did he not, contrary to form of law,</LINE>
<LINE>Devise strange deaths for small offences done?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And did he not, in his protectorship,</LINE>
<LINE>Levy great sums of money through the realm</LINE>
<LINE>For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?</LINE>
<LINE>By means whereof the towns each day revolted.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown.</LINE>
<LINE>Which time will bring to light in smooth</LINE>
<LINE>Duke Humphrey.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lords, at once: the care you have of us,</LINE>
<LINE>To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,</LINE>
<LINE>Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,</LINE>
<LINE>Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent</LINE>
<LINE>From meaning treason to our royal person</LINE>
<LINE>As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:</LINE>
<LINE>The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given</LINE>
<LINE>To dream on evil or to work my downfall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!</LINE>
<LINE>Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,</LINE>
<LINE>For he's disposed as the hateful raven:</LINE>
<LINE>Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,</LINE>
<LINE>For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.</LINE>
<LINE>Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?</LINE>
<LINE>Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all</LINE>
<LINE>Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That all your interest in those territories</LINE>
<LINE>Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Cold news for me; for I had hope of France</LINE>
<LINE>As firmly as I hope for fertile England.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud</LINE>
<LINE>And caterpillars eat my leaves away;</LINE>
<LINE>But I will remedy this gear ere long,</LINE>
<LINE>Or sell my title for a glorious grave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter GLOUCESTER</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>All happiness unto my lord the king!</LINE>
<LINE>Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:</LINE>
<LINE>I do arrest thee of high treason here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush</LINE>
<LINE>Nor change my countenance for this arrest:</LINE>
<LINE>A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.</LINE>
<LINE>The purest spring is not so free from mud</LINE>
<LINE>As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:</LINE>
<LINE>Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,</LINE>
<LINE>And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay;</LINE>
<LINE>By means whereof his highness hath lost France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?</LINE>
<LINE>I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.</LINE>
<LINE>So help me God, as I have watch'd the night,</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,</LINE>
<LINE>That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,</LINE>
<LINE>Or any groat I hoarded to my use,</LINE>
<LINE>Be brought against me at my trial-day!</LINE>
<LINE>No; many a pound of mine own proper store,</LINE>
<LINE>Because I would not tax the needy commons,</LINE>
<LINE>Have I disbursed to the garrisons,</LINE>
<LINE>And never ask'd for restitution.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I say no more than truth, so help me God!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In your protectorship you did devise</LINE>
<LINE>Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,</LINE>
<LINE>That England was defamed by tyranny.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was</LINE>
<LINE>protector,</LINE>
<LINE>Pity was all the fault that was in me;</LINE>
<LINE>For I should melt at an offender's tears,</LINE>
<LINE>And lowly words were ransom for their fault.</LINE>
<LINE>Unless it were a bloody murderer,</LINE>
<LINE>Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,</LINE>
<LINE>I never gave them condign punishment:</LINE>
<LINE>Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured</LINE>
<LINE>Above the felon or what trespass else.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:</LINE>
<LINE>But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,</LINE>
<LINE>Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.</LINE>
<LINE>I do arrest you in his highness' name;</LINE>
<LINE>And here commit you to my lord cardinal</LINE>
<LINE>To keep, until your further time of trial.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope</LINE>
<LINE>That you will clear yourself from all suspect:</LINE>
<LINE>My conscience tells me you are innocent.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:</LINE>
<LINE>Virtue is choked with foul ambition</LINE>
<LINE>And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;</LINE>
<LINE>Foul subornation is predominant</LINE>
<LINE>And equity exiled your highness' land.</LINE>
<LINE>I know their complot is to have my life,</LINE>
<LINE>And if my death might make this island happy,</LINE>
<LINE>And prove the period of their tyranny,</LINE>
<LINE>I would expend it with all willingness:</LINE>
<LINE>But mine is made the prologue to their play;</LINE>
<LINE>For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,</LINE>
<LINE>Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.</LINE>
<LINE>Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,</LINE>
<LINE>And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;</LINE>
<LINE>Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue</LINE>
<LINE>The envious load that lies upon his heart;</LINE>
<LINE>And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,</LINE>
<LINE>By false accuse doth level at my life:</LINE>
<LINE>And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,</LINE>
<LINE>Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,</LINE>
<LINE>And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up</LINE>
<LINE>My liefest liege to be mine enemy:</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, all you have laid your heads together--</LINE>
<LINE>Myself had notice of your conventicles--</LINE>
<LINE>And all to make away my guiltless life.</LINE>
<LINE>I shall not want false witness to condemn me,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;</LINE>
<LINE>The ancient proverb will be well effected:</LINE>
<LINE>'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My liege, his railing is intolerable:</LINE>
<LINE>If those that care to keep your royal person</LINE>
<LINE>From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage</LINE>
<LINE>Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,</LINE>
<LINE>And the offender granted scope of speech,</LINE>
<LINE>'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here</LINE>
<LINE>With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,</LINE>
<LINE>As if she had suborned some to swear</LINE>
<LINE>False allegations to o'erthrow his state?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I can give the loser leave to chide.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;</LINE>
<LINE>Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!</LINE>
<LINE>And well such losers may have leave to speak.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:</LINE>
<LINE>Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>GLOUCESTER</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch</LINE>
<LINE>Before his legs be firm to bear his body.</LINE>
<LINE>Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,</LINE>
<LINE>And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!</LINE>
<LINE>For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit, guarded</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,</LINE>
<LINE>Do or undo, as if ourself were here.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, will your highness leave the parliament?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>My body round engirt with misery,</LINE>
<LINE>For what's more miserable than discontent?</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see</LINE>
<LINE>The map of honour, truth and loyalty:</LINE>
<LINE>And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come</LINE>
<LINE>That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.</LINE>
<LINE>What louring star now envies thy estate,</LINE>
<LINE>That these great lords and Margaret our queen</LINE>
<LINE>Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?</LINE>
<LINE>Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;</LINE>
<LINE>And as the butcher takes away the calf</LINE>
<LINE>And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,</LINE>
<LINE>Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,</LINE>
<LINE>Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;</LINE>
<LINE>And as the dam runs lowing up and down,</LINE>
<LINE>Looking the way her harmless young one went,</LINE>
<LINE>And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,</LINE>
<LINE>Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case</LINE>
<LINE>With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes</LINE>
<LINE>Look after him and cannot do him good,</LINE>
<LINE>So mighty are his vowed enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan</LINE>
<LINE>Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL,
SUFFOLK, and YORK; SOMERSET remains apart</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.</LINE>
<LINE>Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,</LINE>
<LINE>Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show</LINE>
<LINE>Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile</LINE>
<LINE>With sorrow snares relenting passengers,</LINE>
<LINE>Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,</LINE>
<LINE>With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child</LINE>
<LINE>That for the beauty thinks it excellent.</LINE>
<LINE>Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--</LINE>
<LINE>And yet herein I judge mine own wit good--</LINE>
<LINE>This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,</LINE>
<LINE>To rid us of the fear we have of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That he should die is worthy policy;</LINE>
<LINE>But yet we want a colour for his death:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But, in my mind, that were no policy:</LINE>
<LINE>The king will labour still to save his life,</LINE>
<LINE>The commons haply rise, to save his life;</LINE>
<LINE>And yet we have but trivial argument,</LINE>
<LINE>More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So that, by this, you would not have him die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.</LINE>
<LINE>But, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,</LINE>
<LINE>Say as you think, and speak it from your souls,</LINE>
<LINE>Were't not all one, an empty eagle were set</LINE>
<LINE>To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,</LINE>
<LINE>As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So the poor chicken should be sure of death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness, then,</LINE>
<LINE>To make the fox surveyor of the fold?</LINE>
<LINE>Who being accused a crafty murderer,</LINE>
<LINE>His guilt should be but idly posted over,</LINE>
<LINE>Because his purpose is not executed.</LINE>
<LINE>No; let him die, in that he is a fox,</LINE>
<LINE>By nature proved an enemy to the flock,</LINE>
<LINE>Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,</LINE>
<LINE>As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.</LINE>
<LINE>And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:</LINE>
<LINE>Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,</LINE>
<LINE>Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,</LINE>
<LINE>So he be dead; for that is good deceit</LINE>
<LINE>Which mates him first that first intends deceit.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not resolute, except so much were done;</LINE>
<LINE>For things are often spoke and seldom meant:</LINE>
<LINE>But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>Seeing the deed is meritorious,</LINE>
<LINE>And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,</LINE>
<LINE>Say but the word, and I will be his priest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,</LINE>
<LINE>Ere you can take due orders for a priest:</LINE>
<LINE>Say you consent and censure well the deed,</LINE>
<LINE>And I'll provide his executioner,</LINE>
<LINE>I tender so the safety of my liege.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so say I.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And I    and now we three have spoke it,</LINE>
<LINE>It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter a Post</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Post</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain,</LINE>
<LINE>To signify that rebels there are up</LINE>
<LINE>And put the Englishmen unto the sword:</LINE>
<LINE>Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,</LINE>
<LINE>Before the wound do grow uncurable;</LINE>
<LINE>For, being green, there is great hope of help.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!</LINE>
<LINE>What counsel give you in this weighty cause?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That Somerset be sent as regent thither:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd;</LINE>
<LINE>Witness the fortune he hath had in France.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If York, with all his far-fet policy,</LINE>
<LINE>Had been the regent there instead of me,</LINE>
<LINE>He never would have stay'd in France so long.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:</LINE>
<LINE>I rather would have lost my life betimes</LINE>
<LINE>Than bring a burthen of dishonour home</LINE>
<LINE>By staying there so long till all were lost.</LINE>
<LINE>Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:</LINE>
<LINE>Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire,</LINE>
<LINE>If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:</LINE>
<LINE>No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,</LINE>
<LINE>Might happily have proved far worse than his.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take all!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.</LINE>
<LINE>The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms</LINE>
<LINE>And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:</LINE>
<LINE>To Ireland will you lead a band of men,</LINE>
<LINE>Collected choicely, from each county some,</LINE>
<LINE>And try your hap against the Irishmen?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I will, my lord, so please his majesty.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, our authority is his consent,</LINE>
<LINE>And what we do establish he confirms:</LINE>
<LINE>Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.</LINE>
<LINE>But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No more of him; for I will deal with him</LINE>
<LINE>That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.</LINE>
<LINE>And so break off; the day is almost spent:</LINE>
<LINE>Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days</LINE>
<LINE>At Bristol I expect my soldiers;</LINE>
<LINE>For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but YORK</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>And change misdoubt to resolution:</LINE>
<LINE>Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art</LINE>
<LINE>Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:</LINE>
<LINE>Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,</LINE>
<LINE>And find no harbour in a royal heart.</LINE>
<LINE>Faster than spring-time showers comes thought</LINE>
<LINE>on thought,</LINE>
<LINE>And not a thought but thinks on dignity.</LINE>
<LINE>My brain more busy than the labouring spider</LINE>
<LINE>Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,</LINE>
<LINE>To send me packing with an host of men:</LINE>
<LINE>I fear me you but warm the starved snake,</LINE>
<LINE>Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting</LINE>
<LINE>your hearts.</LINE>
<LINE>'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:</LINE>
<LINE>I take it kindly; and yet be well assured</LINE>
<LINE>You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.</LINE>
<LINE>Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,</LINE>
<LINE>I will stir up in England some black storm</LINE>
<LINE>Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;</LINE>
<LINE>And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage</LINE>
<LINE>Until the golden circuit on my head,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,</LINE>
<LINE>Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.</LINE>
<LINE>And, for a minister of my intent,</LINE>
<LINE>I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,</LINE>
<LINE>John Cade of Ashford,</LINE>
<LINE>To make commotion, as full well he can,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the title of John Mortimer.</LINE>
<LINE>In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade</LINE>
<LINE>Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,</LINE>
<LINE>And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts</LINE>
<LINE>Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;</LINE>
<LINE>And, in the end being rescued, I have seen</LINE>
<LINE>Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,</LINE>
<LINE>Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.</LINE>
<LINE>Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath he conversed with the enemy,</LINE>
<LINE>And undiscover'd come to me again</LINE>
<LINE>And given me notice of their villanies.</LINE>
<LINE>This devil here shall be my substitute;</LINE>
<LINE>For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,</LINE>
<LINE>In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:</LINE>
<LINE>By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,</LINE>
<LINE>How they affect the house and claim of York.</LINE>
<LINE>Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,</LINE>
<LINE>I know no pain they can inflict upon him</LINE>
<LINE>Will make him say I moved him to those arms.</LINE>
<LINE>Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,</LINE>
<LINE>Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength</LINE>
<LINE>And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;</LINE>
<LINE>For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,</LINE>
<LINE>And Henry put apart, the next for me.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>KING HENRY VI swoons</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He doth revive again: madam, be patient.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O heavenly God!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fares my gracious lord?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?</LINE>
<LINE>Came he right now to sing a raven's note,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers;</LINE>
<LINE>And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,</LINE>
<LINE>By crying comfort from a hollow breast,</LINE>
<LINE>Can chase away the first-conceived sound?</LINE>
<LINE>Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words;</LINE>
<LINE>Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say;</LINE>
<LINE>Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.</LINE>
<LINE>Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!</LINE>
<LINE>Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny</LINE>
<LINE>Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world.</LINE>
<LINE>Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet do not go away: come, basilisk,</LINE>
<LINE>And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;</LINE>
<LINE>For in the shade of death I shall find joy;</LINE>
<LINE>In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?</LINE>
<LINE>Although the duke was enemy to him,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:</LINE>
<LINE>And for myself, foe as he was to me,</LINE>
<LINE>Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans</LINE>
<LINE>Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,</LINE>
<LINE>I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,</LINE>
<LINE>Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,</LINE>
<LINE>And all to have the noble duke alive.</LINE>
<LINE>What know I how the world may deem of me?</LINE>
<LINE>For it is known we were but hollow friends:</LINE>
<LINE>It may be judged I made the duke away;</LINE>
<LINE>So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,</LINE>
<LINE>And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.</LINE>
<LINE>This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!</LINE>
<LINE>To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.</LINE>
<LINE>What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?</LINE>
<LINE>I am no loathsome leper; look on me.</LINE>
<LINE>What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?</LINE>
<LINE>Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.</LINE>
<LINE>Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.</LINE>
<LINE>Erect his statue and worship it,</LINE>
<LINE>And make my image but an alehouse sign.</LINE>
<LINE>Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea</LINE>
<LINE>And twice by awkward wind from England's bank</LINE>
<LINE>Drove back again unto my native clime?</LINE>
<LINE>What boded this, but well forewarning wind</LINE>
<LINE>Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?</LINE>
<LINE>What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts</LINE>
<LINE>And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:</LINE>
<LINE>And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,</LINE>
<LINE>Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock</LINE>
<LINE>Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,</LINE>
<LINE>But left that hateful office unto thee:</LINE>
<LINE>The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,</LINE>
<LINE>Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,</LINE>
<LINE>With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:</LINE>
<LINE>The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands</LINE>
<LINE>And would not dash me with their ragged sides,</LINE>
<LINE>Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,</LINE>
<LINE>Might in thy palace perish Margaret.</LINE>
<LINE>As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,</LINE>
<LINE>When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,</LINE>
<LINE>I stood upon the hatches in the storm,</LINE>
<LINE>And when the dusky sky began to rob</LINE>
<LINE>My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,</LINE>
<LINE>I took a costly jewel from my neck,</LINE>
<LINE>A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,</LINE>
<LINE>And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,</LINE>
<LINE>And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:</LINE>
<LINE>And even with this I lost fair England's view</LINE>
<LINE>And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart</LINE>
<LINE>And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,</LINE>
<LINE>For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.</LINE>
<LINE>How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>The agent of thy foul inconstancy,</LINE>
<LINE>To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did</LINE>
<LINE>When he to madding Dido would unfold</LINE>
<LINE>His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!</LINE>
<LINE>Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?</LINE>
<LINE>Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!</LINE>
<LINE>For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Noise within. Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, and many Commons</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is reported, mighty sovereign,</LINE>
<LINE>That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd</LINE>
<LINE>By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.</LINE>
<LINE>The commons, like an angry hive of bees</LINE>
<LINE>That want their leader, scatter up and down</LINE>
<LINE>And care not who they sting in his revenge.</LINE>
<LINE>Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,</LINE>
<LINE>Until they hear the order of his death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;</LINE>
<LINE>But how he died God knows, not Henry:</LINE>
<LINE>Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,</LINE>
<LINE>And comment then upon his sudden death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,</LINE>
<LINE>With the rude multitude till I return.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,</LINE>
<LINE>My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul</LINE>
<LINE>Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!</LINE>
<LINE>If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,</LINE>
<LINE>For judgment only doth belong to thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips</LINE>
<LINE>With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain</LINE>
<LINE>Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,</LINE>
<LINE>To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,</LINE>
<LINE>And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:</LINE>
<LINE>But all in vain are these mean obsequies;</LINE>
<LINE>And to survey his dead and earthly image,</LINE>
<LINE>What were it but to make my sorrow greater?</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Re-enter WARWICK and others, bearing
GLOUCESTER'S body on a bed</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That is to see how deep my grave is made;</LINE>
<LINE>For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,</LINE>
<LINE>For seeing him I see my life in death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As surely as my soul intends to live</LINE>
<LINE>With that dread King that took our state upon him</LINE>
<LINE>To free us from his father's wrathful curse,</LINE>
<LINE>I do believe that violent hands were laid</LINE>
<LINE>Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!</LINE>
<LINE>What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See how the blood is settled in his face.</LINE>
<LINE>Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,</LINE>
<LINE>Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,</LINE>
<LINE>Being all descended to the labouring heart;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,</LINE>
<LINE>Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy;</LINE>
<LINE>Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth</LINE>
<LINE>To blush and beautify the cheek again.</LINE>
<LINE>But see, his face is black and full of blood,</LINE>
<LINE>His eye-balls further out than when he lived,</LINE>
<LINE>Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;</LINE>
<LINE>His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling;</LINE>
<LINE>His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd</LINE>
<LINE>And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:</LINE>
<LINE>Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking;</LINE>
<LINE>His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,</LINE>
<LINE>Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.</LINE>
<LINE>It cannot be but he was murder'd here;</LINE>
<LINE>The least of all these signs were probable.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?</LINE>
<LINE>Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;</LINE>
<LINE>And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,</LINE>
<LINE>And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;</LINE>
<LINE>And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen</LINE>
<LINE>As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh</LINE>
<LINE>And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,</LINE>
<LINE>But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?</LINE>
<LINE>Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,</LINE>
<LINE>But may imagine how the bird was dead,</LINE>
<LINE>Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?</LINE>
<LINE>Even so suspicious is this tragedy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?</LINE>
<LINE>Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;</LINE>
<LINE>But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,</LINE>
<LINE>That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart</LINE>
<LINE>That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.</LINE>
<LINE>Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,</LINE>
<LINE>That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He dares not calm his contumelious spirit</LINE>
<LINE>Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,</LINE>
<LINE>Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Madam, be still; with reverence may I say;</LINE>
<LINE>For every word you speak in his behalf</LINE>
<LINE>Is slander to your royal dignity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!</LINE>
<LINE>If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy mother took into her blameful bed</LINE>
<LINE>Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock</LINE>
<LINE>Was graft with crab-tree slip; whose fruit thou art,</LINE>
<LINE>And never of the Nevils' noble race.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee</LINE>
<LINE>And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,</LINE>
<LINE>Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,</LINE>
<LINE>And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,</LINE>
<LINE>I would, false murderous coward, on thy knee</LINE>
<LINE>Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,</LINE>
<LINE>And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st</LINE>
<LINE>That thou thyself was born in bastardy;</LINE>
<LINE>And after all this fearful homage done,</LINE>
<LINE>Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,</LINE>
<LINE>If from this presence thou darest go with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away even now, or I will drag thee hence:</LINE>
<LINE>Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee</LINE>
<LINE>And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!</LINE>
<LINE>Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,</LINE>
<LINE>And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel</LINE>
<LINE>Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.</LINE>

<SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, how now, lords! your wrathful weapons drawn</LINE>
<LINE>Here in our presence! dare you be so bold?</LINE>
<LINE>Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury</LINE>
<LINE>Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>To the Commons, entering</STAGEDIR>  Sirs, stand apart;</LINE>
<LINE>the king shall know your mind.</LINE>
<LINE>Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,</LINE>
<LINE>Or banished fair England's territories,</LINE>
<LINE>They will by violence tear him from your palace</LINE>
<LINE>And torture him with grievous lingering death.</LINE>
<LINE>They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;</LINE>
<LINE>They say, in him they fear your highness' death;</LINE>
<LINE>And mere instinct of love and loyalty,</LINE>
<LINE>Free from a stubborn opposite intent,</LINE>
<LINE>As being thought to contradict your liking,</LINE>
<LINE>Makes them thus forward in his banishment.</LINE>
<LINE>They say, in care of your most royal person,</LINE>
<LINE>That if your highness should intend to sleep</LINE>
<LINE>And charge that no man should disturb your rest</LINE>
<LINE>In pain of your dislike or pain of death,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,</LINE>
<LINE>Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,</LINE>
<LINE>That slily glided towards your majesty,</LINE>
<LINE>It were but necessary you were waked,</LINE>
<LINE>Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,</LINE>
<LINE>The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal;</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,</LINE>
<LINE>That they will guard you, whether you will or no,</LINE>
<LINE>From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,</LINE>
<LINE>With whose envenomed and fatal sting,</LINE>
<LINE>Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,</LINE>
<LINE>They say, is shamefully bereft of life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Commons</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  An answer from the king, my</LINE>
<LINE>Lord of Salisbury!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds,</LINE>
<LINE>Could send such message to their sovereign:</LINE>
<LINE>But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,</LINE>
<LINE>To show how quaint an orator you are:</LINE>
<LINE>But all the honour Salisbury hath won</LINE>
<LINE>Is, that he was the lord ambassador</LINE>
<LINE>Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Commons</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Within</STAGEDIR>  An answer from the king, or we will all break in!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me.</LINE>
<LINE>I thank them for their tender loving care;</LINE>
<LINE>And had I not been cited so by them,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;</LINE>
<LINE>For, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy</LINE>
<LINE>Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore, by His majesty I swear,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose far unworthy deputy I am,</LINE>
<LINE>He shall not breathe infection in this air</LINE>
<LINE>But three days longer, on the pain of death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit SALISBURY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!</LINE>
<LINE>No more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.</LINE>
<LINE>Had I but said, I would have kept my word,</LINE>
<LINE>But when I swear, it is irrevocable.</LINE>
<LINE>If, after three days' space, thou here be'st found</LINE>
<LINE>On any ground that I am ruler of,</LINE>
<LINE>The world shall not be ransom for thy life.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;</LINE>
<LINE>I have great matters to impart to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Mischance and sorrow go along with you!</LINE>
<LINE>Heart's discontent and sour affliction</LINE>
<LINE>Be playfellows to keep you company!</LINE>
<LINE>There's two of you; the devil make a third!</LINE>
<LINE>And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,</LINE>
<LINE>And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?</LINE>
<LINE>Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,</LINE>
<LINE>I would invent as bitter-searching terms,</LINE>
<LINE>As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,</LINE>
<LINE>Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,</LINE>
<LINE>With full as many signs of deadly hate,</LINE>
<LINE>As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:</LINE>
<LINE>My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;</LINE>
<LINE>Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;</LINE>
<LINE>Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:</LINE>
<LINE>And even now my burthen'd heart would break,</LINE>
<LINE>Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!</LINE>
<LINE>Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!</LINE>
<LINE>Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!</LINE>
<LINE>Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!</LINE>
<LINE>Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!</LINE>
<LINE>Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,</LINE>
<LINE>And boding screech-owls make the concert full!</LINE>
<LINE>All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Enough, sweet Suffolk; thou torment'st thyself;</LINE>
<LINE>And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,</LINE>
<LINE>Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,</LINE>
<LINE>And turn the force of them upon thyself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?</LINE>
<LINE>Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,</LINE>
<LINE>Well could I curse away a winter's night,</LINE>
<LINE>Though standing naked on a mountain top,</LINE>
<LINE>Where biting cold would never let grass grow,</LINE>
<LINE>And think it but a minute spent in sport.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>That I may dew it with my mournful tears;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,</LINE>
<LINE>To wash away my woful monuments.</LINE>
<LINE>O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,</LINE>
<LINE>That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,</LINE>
<LINE>Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!</LINE>
<LINE>So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,</LINE>
<LINE>As one that surfeits thinking on a want.</LINE>
<LINE>I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,</LINE>
<LINE>Adventure to be banished myself:</LINE>
<LINE>And banished I am, if but from thee.</LINE>
<LINE>Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.</LINE>
<LINE>O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'd</LINE>
<LINE>Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,</LINE>
<LINE>Loather a hundred times to part than die.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished;</LINE>
<LINE>Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;</LINE>
<LINE>A wilderness is populous enough,</LINE>
<LINE>So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:</LINE>
<LINE>For where thou art, there is the world itself,</LINE>
<LINE>With every several pleasure in the world,</LINE>
<LINE>And where thou art not, desolation.</LINE>
<LINE>I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;</LINE>
<LINE>Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter VAUX</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>VAUX</SPEAKER>
<LINE>To signify unto his majesty</LINE>
<LINE>That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;</LINE>
<LINE>For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,</LINE>
<LINE>That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,</LINE>
<LINE>Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.</LINE>
<LINE>Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost</LINE>
<LINE>Were by his side; sometime he calls the king,</LINE>
<LINE>And whispers to his pillow, as to him,</LINE>
<LINE>The secrets of his overcharged soul;</LINE>
<LINE>And I am sent to tell his majesty</LINE>
<LINE>That even now he cries aloud for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Go tell this heavy message to the king.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit VAUX</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!</LINE>
<LINE>But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,</LINE>
<LINE>Omitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?</LINE>
<LINE>Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,</LINE>
<LINE>And with the southern clouds contend in tears,</LINE>
<LINE>Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?</LINE>
<LINE>Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming;</LINE>
<LINE>If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If I depart from thee, I cannot live;</LINE>
<LINE>And in thy sight to die, what were it else</LINE>
<LINE>But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?</LINE>
<LINE>Here could I breathe my soul into the air,</LINE>
<LINE>As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe</LINE>
<LINE>Dying with mother's dug between its lips:</LINE>
<LINE>Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,</LINE>
<LINE>And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,</LINE>
<LINE>To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;</LINE>
<LINE>So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,</LINE>
<LINE>Or I should breathe it so into thy body,</LINE>
<LINE>And then it lived in sweet Elysium.</LINE>
<LINE>To die by thee were but to die in jest;</LINE>
<LINE>From thee to die were torture more than death:</LINE>
<LINE>O, let me stay, befall what may befall!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,</LINE>
<LINE>It is applied to a deathful wound.</LINE>
<LINE>To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;</LINE>
<LINE>For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,</LINE>
<LINE>I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And take my heart with thee.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask</LINE>
<LINE>That ever did contain a thing of worth.</LINE>
<LINE>Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we</LINE>
<LINE>This way fall I to death.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>How fares my lord? speak, Beaufort, to</LINE>
<LINE>thy sovereign.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,</LINE>
<LINE>Enough to purchase such another island,</LINE>
<LINE>So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,</LINE>
<LINE>Where death's approach is seen so terrible!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CARDINAL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Bring me unto my trial when you will.</LINE>
<LINE>Died he not in his bed? where should he die?</LINE>
<LINE>Can I make men live, whether they will or no?</LINE>
<LINE>O, torture me no more! I will confess.</LINE>
<LINE>Alive again? then show me where he is:</LINE>
<LINE>I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.</LINE>
<LINE>He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.</LINE>
<LINE>Comb down his hair; look, look! it stands upright,</LINE>
<LINE>Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.</LINE>
<LINE>Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary</LINE>
<LINE>Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.</LINE>
<LINE>Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!</LINE>
<LINE>O, beat away the busy meddling fiend</LINE>
<LINE>That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul.</LINE>
<LINE>And from his bosom purge this black despair!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>See, how the pangs of death do make him grin!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Disturb him not; let him pass peaceably.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!</LINE>
<LINE>Lord cardinal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,</LINE>
<LINE>Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.</LINE>
<LINE>He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So bad a death argues a monstrous life.</LINE>

</ACT>

<ACT><TITLE>ACT IV</TITLE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  The coast of Kent.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Alarum. Fight at sea. Ordnance goes off. Enter a
Captain, a Master, a Master's-mate, WALTER WHITMORE,
and others; with them SUFFOLK, and others, prisoners</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day</LINE>
<LINE>Is crept into the bosom of the sea;</LINE>
<LINE>And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades</LINE>
<LINE>That drag the tragic melancholy night;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,</LINE>
<LINE>Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws</LINE>
<LINE>Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;</LINE>
<LINE>For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,</LINE>
<LINE>Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,</LINE>
<LINE>Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.</LINE>
<LINE>Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;</LINE>
<LINE>And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;</LINE>
<LINE>The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is my ransom, master? let me know.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Master</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Master's-Mate</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,</LINE>
<LINE>And bear the name and port of gentlemen?</LINE>
<LINE>Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:</LINE>
<LINE>The lives of those which we have lost in fight</LINE>
<LINE>Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Second Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so will I and write home for it straight.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>To SUFFOLK</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>And so should these, if I might have my will.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look on my George; I am a gentleman:</LINE>
<LINE>Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.</LINE>
<LINE>How now! why start'st thou? what, doth</LINE>
<LINE>death affright?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.</LINE>
<LINE>A cunning man did calculate my birth</LINE>
<LINE>And told me that by water I should die:</LINE>
<LINE>Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:</LINE>
<LINE>Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,</LINE>
<LINE>But with our sword we wiped away the blot;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,</LINE>
<LINE>Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,</LINE>
<LINE>And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,</LINE>
<LINE>The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:</LINE>
<LINE>Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,</LINE>
<LINE>The honourable blood of Lancaster,</LINE>
<LINE>Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.</LINE>
<LINE>Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?</LINE>
<LINE>Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule</LINE>
<LINE>And thought thee happy when I shook my head?</LINE>
<LINE>How often hast thou waited at my cup,</LINE>
<LINE>Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.</LINE>
<LINE>When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?</LINE>
<LINE>Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;</LINE>
<LINE>How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood</LINE>
<LINE>And duly waited for my coming forth?</LINE>
<LINE>This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,</LINE>
<LINE>And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>First let my words stab him, as he hath me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Convey him hence and on our longboat's side</LINE>
<LINE>Strike off his head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou darest not, for thy own.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, Pole.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pole!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pool! Sir Pool! lord!</LINE>
<LINE>Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt</LINE>
<LINE>Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.</LINE>
<LINE>Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth</LINE>
<LINE>For swallowing the treasure of the realm:</LINE>
<LINE>Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;</LINE>
<LINE>And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,</LINE>
<LINE>Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,</LINE>
<LINE>Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:</LINE>
<LINE>And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>For daring to affy a mighty lord</LINE>
<LINE>Unto the daughter of a worthless king,</LINE>
<LINE>Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.</LINE>
<LINE>By devilish policy art thou grown great,</LINE>
<LINE>And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged</LINE>
<LINE>With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.</LINE>
<LINE>By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,</LINE>
<LINE>The false revolting Normans thorough thee</LINE>
<LINE>Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy</LINE>
<LINE>Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,</LINE>
<LINE>And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.</LINE>
<LINE>The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,</LINE>
<LINE>Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,</LINE>
<LINE>As hating thee, are rising up in arms:</LINE>
<LINE>And now the house of York, thrust from the crown</LINE>
<LINE>By shameful murder of a guiltless king</LINE>
<LINE>And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,</LINE>
<LINE>Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours</LINE>
<LINE>Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,</LINE>
<LINE>Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'</LINE>
<LINE>The commons here in Kent are up in arms:</LINE>
<LINE>And, to conclude, reproach and beggary</LINE>
<LINE>Is crept into the palace of our king.</LINE>
<LINE>And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder</LINE>
<LINE>Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!</LINE>
<LINE>Small things make base men proud: this villain here,</LINE>
<LINE>Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more</LINE>
<LINE>Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.</LINE>
<LINE>Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:</LINE>
<LINE>It is impossible that I should die</LINE>
<LINE>By such a lowly vassal as thyself.</LINE>
<LINE>Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:</LINE>
<LINE>I go of message from the queen to France;</LINE>
<LINE>I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Walter,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.</LINE>
<LINE>What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,</LINE>
<LINE>Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.</LINE>
<LINE>Far be it we should honour such as these</LINE>
<LINE>With humble suit: no, rather let my head</LINE>
<LINE>Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any</LINE>
<LINE>Save to the God of heaven and to my king;</LINE>
<LINE>And sooner dance upon a bloody pole</LINE>
<LINE>Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.</LINE>
<LINE>True nobility is exempt from fear:</LINE>
<LINE>More can I bear than you dare execute.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hale him away, and let him talk no more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SUFFOLK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,</LINE>
<LINE>That this my death may never be forgot!</LINE>
<LINE>Great men oft die by vile bezonians:</LINE>
<LINE>A Roman sworder and banditto slave</LINE>
<LINE>Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand</LINE>
<LINE>Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders</LINE>
<LINE>Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Captain</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And as for these whose ransom we have set,</LINE>
<LINE>It is our pleasure one of them depart;</LINE>
<LINE>Therefore come you with us and let him go.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt all but the First Gentleman</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Re-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WHITMORE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>There let his head and lifeless body lie,</LINE>
<LINE>Until the queen his mistress bury it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>First Gentleman</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O barbarous and bloody spectacle!</LINE>
<LINE>His body will I bear unto the king:</LINE>
<LINE>If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;</LINE>
<LINE>So will the queen, that living held him dear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit with the body</STAGEDIR>
</SCENE>

<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE II.  Blackheath.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEVIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath;</LINE>
<LINE>they have been up these two days.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOLLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>They have the more need to sleep now, then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEVIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress</LINE>
<LINE>the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOLLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it</LINE>
<LINE>was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEVIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOLLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEVIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOLLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;</LINE>
<LINE>which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be</LINE>
<LINE>labouring men; and therefore should we be</LINE>
<LINE>magistrates.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEVIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a</LINE>
<LINE>brave mind than a hard hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOLLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I see them! I see them! there's Best's son, the</LINE>
<LINE>tanner of Wingham,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEVIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He shall have the skin of our enemies, to make</LINE>
<LINE>dog's-leather of.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOLLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And Dick the Butcher,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEVIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity's</LINE>
<LINE>throat cut like a calf.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOLLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And Smith the weaver,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BEVIS</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Argo, their thread of life is spun.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>HOLLAND</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Come, come, let's fall in with them.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Drum. Enter CADE, DICK the Butcher, SMITH the
Weaver, and a Sawyer, with infinite numbers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>We John Cade, so termed of our supposed father,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with</LINE>
<LINE>the spirit of putting down kings and princes,</LINE>
<LINE>--Command silence.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Silence!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My father was a Mortimer,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  He was an honest man, and a good</LINE>
<LINE>bricklayer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My mother a Plantagenet,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  I knew her well; she was a midwife.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My wife descended of the Lacies,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, and</LINE>
<LINE>sold many laces.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SMITH</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  But now of late, notable to travel with her</LINE>
<LINE>furred pack, she washes bucks here at home.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Therefore am I of an honourable house.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable;</LINE>
<LINE>and there was he borne, under a hedge, for his</LINE>
<LINE>father had never a house but the cage.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Valiant I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SMITH</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  A' must needs; for beggary is valiant.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am able to endure much.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  No question of that; for I have seen him</LINE>
<LINE>whipped three market-days together.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I fear neither sword nor fire.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SMITH</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  He need not fear the sword; for his coat is of proof.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  But methinks he should stand in fear of</LINE>
<LINE>fire, being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Be brave, then; for your captain is brave, and vows</LINE>
<LINE>reformation. There shall be in England seven</LINE>
<LINE>halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hooped</LINE>
<LINE>pot; shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony</LINE>
<LINE>to drink small beer: all the realm shall be in</LINE>
<LINE>common; and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to</LINE>
<LINE>grass: and when I am king, as king I will be,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>God save your majesty!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank you, good people: there shall be no money;</LINE>
<LINE>all shall eat and drink on my score; and I will</LINE>
<LINE>apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree</LINE>
<LINE>like brothers and worship me their lord.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable</LINE>
<LINE>thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should</LINE>
<LINE>be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled</LINE>
<LINE>o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:</LINE>
<LINE>but I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal</LINE>
<LINE>once to a thing, and I was never mine own man</LINE>
<LINE>since. How now! who's there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter some, bringing forward the Clerk of Chatham</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, then, he is a conjurer.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, he can make obligations, and write court-hand.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man, of mine</LINE>
<LINE>honour; unless I find him guilty, he shall not die.</LINE>
<LINE>Come hither, sirrah, I must examine thee: what is thy name?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>They use to write it on the top of letters: 'twill</LINE>

<SPEAKER>SIR HUMPHREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,</LINE>
<LINE>Mark'd for the gallows, lay your weapons down;</LINE>
<LINE>Home to your cottages, forsake this groom:</LINE>
<LINE>The king is merciful, if you revolt.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM STAFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,</LINE>
<LINE>If you go forward; therefore yield, or die.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not:</LINE>
<LINE>It is to you, good people, that I speak,</LINE>
<LINE>Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign;</LINE>
<LINE>For I am rightful heir unto the crown.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUMPHREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Villain, thy father was a plasterer;</LINE>
<LINE>And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And Adam was a gardener.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM STAFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And what of that?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.</LINE>
<LINE>Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUMPHREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By her he had two children at one birth.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM STAFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>That's false.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, there's the question; but I say, 'tis true:</LINE>
<LINE>The elder of them, being put to nurse,</LINE>
<LINE>Was by a beggar-woman stolen away;</LINE>
<LINE>And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,</LINE>
<LINE>Became a bricklayer when he came to age:</LINE>
<LINE>His son am I; deny it, if you can.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SMITH</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and</LINE>
<LINE>the bricks are alive at this day to testify it;</LINE>
<LINE>therefore deny it not.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUMPHREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And will you credit this base drudge's words,</LINE>
<LINE>That speaks he knows not what?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM STAFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE><STAGEDIR>Aside</STAGEDIR>  He lies, for I invented it myself.</LINE>
<LINE>Go to, sirrah, tell the king from me, that, for his</LINE>
<LINE>father's sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boys</LINE>
<LINE>went to span-counter for French crowns, I am content</LINE>
<LINE>he shall reign; but I'll be protector over him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>DICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And furthermore, well have the Lord Say's head for</LINE>
<LINE>selling the dukedom of Maine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And good reason; for thereby is England mained, and</LINE>
<LINE>fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds</LINE>
<LINE>it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say</LINE>
<LINE>hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch:</LINE>
<LINE>and more than that, he can speak French; and</LINE>
<LINE>therefore he is a traitor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUMPHREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O gross and miserable ignorance!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are our</LINE>
<LINE>enemies; go to, then, I ask but this: can he that</LINE>
<LINE>speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good</LINE>
<LINE>counsellor, or no?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>ALL</SPEAKER>
<LINE>No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WILLIAM STAFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,</LINE>
<LINE>Assail them with the army of the king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SIR HUMPHREY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Herald, away; and throughout every town</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;</LINE>
<LINE>That those which fly before the battle ends</LINE>
<LINE>May, even in their wives' and children's sight,</LINE>
<LINE>Be hang'd up for example at their doors:</LINE>
<LINE>And you that be the king's friends, follow me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt WILLIAM STAFFORD and SIR HUMPHREY, and soldiers</STAGEDIR>

<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And you that love the commons, follow me.</LINE>
<LINE>Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.</LINE>
<LINE>We will not leave one lord, one gentleman:</LINE>
<LINE>Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;</LINE>
<LINE>For they are thrifty honest men, and such</LINE>

<LINE>Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times. Ah,</LINE>
<LINE>thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord! now</LINE>
<LINE>art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction</LINE>
<LINE>regal. What canst thou answer to my majesty for</LINE>
<LINE>giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu, the</LINE>
<LINE>dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these</LINE>
<LINE>presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I</LINE>
<LINE>am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such</LINE>
<LINE>filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously</LINE>

<LINE>grammar school; and whereas, before, our forefathers</LINE>

<LINE>hast caused printing to be used, and, contrary to</LINE>

<LINE>hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and</LINE>
<LINE>a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian</LINE>

<LINE>Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because</LINE>
<LINE>they could not read, thou hast hanged them; when,</LINE>

<LINE>Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.</LINE>
<LINE>When have I aught exacted at your hands,</LINE>
<LINE>But to maintain the king, the realm and you?</LINE>
<LINE>Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,</LINE>
<LINE>Because my book preferr'd me to the king,</LINE>
<LINE>And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,</LINE>
<LINE>Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits,</LINE>

<LINE>has a familiar under his tongue; he speaks not o'</LINE>
<LINE>God's name. Go, take him away, I say, and strike</LINE>
<LINE>off his head presently; and then break into his</LINE>
<LINE>son-in-law's house, Sir James Cromer, and strike off</LINE>
<LINE>his head, and bring them both upon two poles hither.</LINE>

<LINE>Ah, countrymen! if when you make your prayers,</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Exeunt some with Lord SAY</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head</LINE>

<LINE>some more towns in France. Soldiers, defer the</LINE>

<LINE>What say ye, countrymen? will ye relent,</LINE>

<LINE>Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon,</LINE>
<LINE>Fling up his cap, and say 'God save his majesty!'</LINE>

<LINE>needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks?</LINE>
<LINE>Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,</LINE>
<LINE>that you should leave me at the White Hart in</LINE>
<LINE>Southwark? I thought ye would never have given out</LINE>
<LINE>these arms till you had recovered your ancient</LINE>
<LINE>freedom: but you are all recreants and dastards,</LINE>
<LINE>and delight to live in slavery to the nobility. Let</LINE>
<LINE>them break your backs with burthens, take your</LINE>
<LINE>houses over your heads, ravish your wives and</LINE>

<LINE>Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth,</LINE>
<LINE>That thus you do exclaim you'll go with him?</LINE>
<LINE>Will he conduct you through the heart of France,</LINE>
<LINE>And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?</LINE>
<LINE>Alas, he hath no home, no place to fly to;</LINE>
<LINE>Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,</LINE>
<LINE>Unless by robbing of your friends and us.</LINE>
<LINE>Were't not a shame, that whilst you live at jar,</LINE>
<LINE>The fearful French, whom you late vanquished,</LINE>
<LINE>Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you?</LINE>
<LINE>Methinks already in this civil broil</LINE>
<LINE>I see them lording it in London streets,</LINE>
<LINE>Crying 'Villiago!' unto all they meet.</LINE>
<LINE>Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry</LINE>
<LINE>Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy.</LINE>
<LINE>To France, to France, and get what you have lost;</LINE>
<LINE>Spare England, for it is your native coast;</LINE>
<LINE>Henry hath money, you are strong and manly;</LINE>

<LINE>Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this</LINE>
<LINE>multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them</LINE>
<LINE>to an hundred mischiefs, and makes them leave me</LINE>
<LINE>desolate. I see them lay their heads together to</LINE>
<LINE>surprise me. My sword make way for me, for here is</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>Messenger</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Please it your grace to be advertised</LINE>
<LINE>The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland,</LINE>
<LINE>And with a puissant and a mighty power</LINE>
<LINE>Of gallowglasses and stout kerns</LINE>
<LINE>Is marching hitherward in proud array,</LINE>
<LINE>And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,</LINE>
<LINE>His arms are only to remove from thee</LINE>
<LINE>The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms traitor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd.</LINE>
<LINE>Like to a ship that, having 'scaped a tempest,</LINE>
<LINE>Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate:</LINE>
<LINE>But now is Cade driven back, his men dispersed;</LINE>
<LINE>And now is York in arms to second him.</LINE>
<LINE>I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,</LINE>
<LINE>And ask him what's the reason of these arms.</LINE>
<LINE>Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;</LINE>
<LINE>And, Somerset, we'll commit thee thither,</LINE>
<LINE>Until his army be dismiss'd from him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord,</LINE>

<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>In any case, be not too rough in terms;</LINE>

<STAGEDIR>Enter CADE</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie on ambition! fie on myself, that have a sword,</LINE>
<LINE>and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I</LINE>
<LINE>hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for</LINE>
<LINE>all the country is laid for me; but now am I so</LINE>
<LINE>hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a</LINE>
<LINE>thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore,</LINE>
<LINE>on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to</LINE>
<LINE>see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another</LINE>
<LINE>while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach</LINE>
<LINE>this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'</LINE>
<LINE>was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a</LINE>
<LINE>sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown</LINE>
<LINE>bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and</LINE>
<LINE>bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a</LINE>
<LINE>quart pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'</LINE>
<LINE>must serve me to feed on.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter IDEN</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IDEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,</LINE>
<LINE>And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?</LINE>
<LINE>This small inheritance my father left me</LINE>
<LINE>Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.</LINE>
<LINE>I seek not to wax great by others' waning,</LINE>
<LINE>Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy:</LINE>
<LINE>Sufficeth that I have maintains my state</LINE>
<LINE>And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a</LINE>
<LINE>stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand</LINE>
<LINE>crowns of the king carrying my head to him: but</LINE>
<LINE>I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow</LINE>
<LINE>my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IDEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,</LINE>
<LINE>I know thee not; why, then, should I betray thee?</LINE>
<LINE>Is't not enough to break into my garden,</LINE>
<LINE>And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,</LINE>
<LINE>Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,</LINE>
<LINE>But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was</LINE>
<LINE>broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I</LINE>
<LINE>have eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou and</LINE>
<LINE>thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead</LINE>
<LINE>as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IDEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,</LINE>
<LINE>That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,</LINE>
<LINE>Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.</LINE>
<LINE>Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,</LINE>
<LINE>See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:</LINE>
<LINE>Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;</LINE>
<LINE>Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;</LINE>
<LINE>My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;</LINE>
<LINE>And if mine arm be heaved in the air,</LINE>
<LINE>Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.</LINE>
<LINE>As for words, whose greatness answers words,</LINE>
<LINE>Let this my sword report what speech forbears.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I</LINE>
<LINE>heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out</LINE>
<LINE>the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou</LINE>
<LINE>sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thou</LINE>
<LINE>mayst be turned to hobnails.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Here they fight. CADE falls</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain me:</LINE>
<LINE>let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me</LINE>
<LINE>but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them</LINE>
<LINE>all. Wither, garden; and be henceforth a</LINE>
<LINE>burying-place to all that do dwell in this house,</LINE>
<LINE>because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IDEN</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?</LINE>
<LINE>Sword, I will hollow thee for this thy deed,</LINE>
<LINE>And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:</LINE>
<LINE>Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point;</LINE>
<LINE>But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,</LINE>
<LINE>To emblaze the honour that thy master got.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CADE</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell</LINE>
<LINE>Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort</LINE>
<LINE>all the world to be cowards; for I, that never</LINE>
<LINE>feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour.</LINE>

<LINE>So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.</LINE>
<LINE>Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels</LINE>
<LINE>Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,</LINE>

<LINE>To entertain great England's lawful king.</LINE>
<LINE>Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?</LINE>
<LINE>Let them obey that know not how to rule;</LINE>
<LINE>This hand was made to handle naught but gold.</LINE>
<LINE>I cannot give due action to my words,</LINE>
<LINE>Except a sword or sceptre balance it:</LINE>
<LINE>A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul,</LINE>
<LINE>On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter BUCKINGHAM</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?</LINE>

</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BUCKINGHAM</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,</LINE>
<LINE>To know the reason of these arms in peace;</LINE>
<LINE>Or why thou, being a subject as I am,</LINE>

<LINE>On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.</LINE>
<LINE>I am far better born than is the king,</LINE>
<LINE>More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:</LINE>

<LINE>Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--</LINE>
<LINE>Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,</LINE>
<LINE>That I have given no answer all this while;</LINE>
<LINE>My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.</LINE>
<LINE>The cause why I have brought this army hither</LINE>
<LINE>Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,</LINE>
<LINE>Seditious to his grace and to the state.</LINE>

<SPEAKER>SOMERSET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,</LINE>
<LINE>Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown;</LINE>
<LINE>Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,</LINE>
<LINE>If they can brook I bow a knee to man.</LINE>
<LINE>Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Exit Attendant</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>I know, ere they will have me go to ward,</LINE>
<LINE>They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,</LINE>
<LINE>To say if that the bastard boys of York</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be the surety for their traitor father.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit BUCKINGHAM</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O blood-besotted Neapolitan,</LINE>
<LINE>Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!</LINE>
<LINE>The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be their father's bail; and bane to those</LINE>
<LINE>That for my surety will refuse the boys!</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter EDWARD and RICHARD</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>See where they come: I'll warrant they'll</LINE>
<LINE>make it good.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Health and all happiness to my lord the king!</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?</LINE>
<LINE>Nay, do not fright us with an angry look;</LINE>
<LINE>We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;</LINE>
<LINE>For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This is my king, York, I do not mistake;</LINE>
<LINE>But thou mistakest me much to think I do:</LINE>
<LINE>To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour</LINE>
<LINE>Makes him oppose himself against his king.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,</LINE>
<LINE>And chop away that factious pate of his.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>He is arrested, but will not obey;</LINE>
<LINE>His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Will you not, sons?</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>EDWARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And if words will not, then our weapons shall.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Look in a glass, and call thy image so:</LINE>
<LINE>I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.</LINE>
<LINE>Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,</LINE>
<LINE>That with the very shaking of their chains</LINE>
<LINE>They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:</LINE>
<LINE>Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.</LINE>
<LINE>And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,</LINE>
<LINE>If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur</LINE>
<LINE>Run back and bite, because he was withheld;</LINE>
<LINE>Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,</LINE>
<LINE>Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:</LINE>
<LINE>And such a piece of service will you do,</LINE>
<LINE>If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,</LINE>
<LINE>As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?</LINE>
<LINE>Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,</LINE>
<LINE>Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!</LINE>
<LINE>What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,</LINE>
<LINE>And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?</LINE>
<LINE>O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?</LINE>
<LINE>If it be banish'd from the frosty head,</LINE>
<LINE>Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?</LINE>
<LINE>Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,</LINE>
<LINE>And shame thine honourable age with blood?</LINE>
<LINE>Why art thou old, and want'st experience?</LINE>
<LINE>Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?</LINE>
<LINE>For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me</LINE>
<LINE>That bows unto the grave with mickle age.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My lord, I have consider'd with myself</LINE>
<LINE>The title of this most renowned duke;</LINE>
<LINE>And in my conscience do repute his grace</LINE>
<LINE>The rightful heir to England's royal seat.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I have.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>SALISBURY</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is great sin to swear unto a sin,</LINE>
<LINE>But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.</LINE>
<LINE>Who can be bound by any solemn vow</LINE>
<LINE>To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,</LINE>
<LINE>To force a spotless virgin's chastity,</LINE>
<LINE>To reave the orphan of his patrimony,</LINE>
<LINE>To wring the widow from her custom'd right,</LINE>
<LINE>And have no other reason for this wrong</LINE>
<LINE>But that he was bound by a solemn oath?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>A subtle traitor needs no sophister.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>KING HENRY VI</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,</LINE>
<LINE>I am resolved for death or dignity.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You were best to go to bed and dream again,</LINE>
<LINE>To keep thee from the tempest of the field.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am resolved to bear a greater storm</LINE>
<LINE>Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;</LINE>
<LINE>And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,</LINE>
<LINE>Might I but know thee by thy household badge.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,</LINE>
<LINE>The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,</LINE>
<LINE>This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,</LINE>
<LINE>As on a mountain top the cedar shows</LINE>
<LINE>That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,</LINE>
<LINE>Even to affright thee with the view thereof.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear</LINE>
<LINE>And tread it under foot with all contempt,</LINE>
<LINE>Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>And so to arms, victorious father,</LINE>
<LINE>To quell the rebels and their complices.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,</LINE>
<LINE>For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<LINE>If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls:</LINE>
<LINE>And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,</LINE>
<LINE>Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum</LINE>
<LINE>And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,</LINE>
<LINE>Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me:</LINE>
<LINE>Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,</LINE>
<LINE>Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter YORK</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed,</LINE>
<LINE>But match to match I have encounter'd him</LINE>
<LINE>And made a prey for carrion kites and crows</LINE>
<LINE>Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Enter CLIFFORD</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Of one or both of us the time is come.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,</LINE>
<LINE>For I myself must hunt this deer to death.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>WARWICK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.</LINE>
<LINE>As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,</LINE>
<LINE>It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>With thy brave bearing should I be in love,</LINE>
<LINE>But that thou art so fast mine enemy.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,</LINE>
<LINE>But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YORK</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So let it help me now against thy sword</LINE>
<LINE>As I in justice and true right express it.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My soul and body on the action both!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.</LINE>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Shame and confusion! all is on the rout;</LINE>
<LINE>Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds</LINE>
<LINE>Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,</LINE>
<LINE>Whom angry heavens do make their minister</LINE>
<LINE>Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part</LINE>
<LINE>Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.</LINE>
<LINE>He that is truly dedicate to war</LINE>
<LINE>Hath no self-love, nor he that loves himself</LINE>
<LINE>Hath not essentially but by circumstance</LINE>
<LINE>The name of valour.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Seeing his dead father</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>O, let the vile world end,</LINE>
<LINE>And the premised flames of the last day</LINE>
<LINE>Knit earth and heaven together!</LINE>
<LINE>Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,</LINE>
<LINE>Particularities and petty sounds</LINE>
<LINE>To cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,</LINE>
<LINE>To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve</LINE>
<LINE>The silver livery of advised age,</LINE>
<LINE>And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus</LINE>
<LINE>To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight</LINE>
<LINE>My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,</LINE>
<LINE>It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;</LINE>
<LINE>No more will I their babes: tears virginal</LINE>
<LINE>Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,</LINE>
<LINE>And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims</LINE>
<LINE>Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.</LINE>
<LINE>Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:</LINE>
<LINE>Meet I an infant of the house of York,</LINE>
<LINE>Into as many gobbets will I cut it</LINE>
<LINE>As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:</LINE>
<LINE>In cruelty will I seek out my fame.</LINE>
<LINE>Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house:</LINE>
<LINE>As did AEneas old Anchises bear,</LINE>
<LINE>So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;</LINE>
<LINE>But then AEneas bare a living load,</LINE>
<LINE>Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit, bearing off his father</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight. SOMERSET

<SPEAKER>RICHARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>So, lie thou there;</LINE>
<LINE>For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,</LINE>
<LINE>The Castle in Saint Alban's, Somerset</LINE>
<LINE>Hath made the wizard famous in his death.</LINE>
<LINE>Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:</LINE>
<LINE>Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.</LINE>

<LINE>Can we outrun the heavens? good Margaret, stay.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>QUEEN MARGARET</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:</LINE>
<LINE>Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,</LINE>
<LINE>To give the enemy way, and to secure us</LINE>
<LINE>By what we can, which can no more but fly.</LINE>
<STAGEDIR>Alarum afar off</STAGEDIR>
<LINE>If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom</LINE>
<LINE>Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,</LINE>
<LINE>As well we may, if not through your neglect,</LINE>
<LINE>We shall to London get, where you are loved</LINE>
<LINE>And where this breach now in our fortunes made</LINE>
<LINE>May readily be stopp'd.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Re-enter YOUNG CLIFFORD</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>YOUNG CLIFFORD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But that my heart's on future mischief set,</LINE>
<LINE>I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly:</LINE>
<LINE>But fly you must; uncurable discomfit</LINE>
<LINE>Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.</LINE>
<LINE>Away, for your relief! and we will live</LINE>
<LINE>To see their day and them our fortune give:</LINE>

<LINE>Of Salisbury, who can report of him,</LINE>
<LINE>That winter lion, who in rage forgets</LINE>
<LINE>Aged contusions and all brush of time,</LINE>
<LINE>And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,</LINE>

<LINE>Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,</LINE>
<LINE>If Salisbury be lost.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RICHARD</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My noble father,</LINE>
<LINE>Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,</LINE>
<LINE>Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,</LINE>
<LINE>Persuaded him from any further act:</LINE>
<LINE>But still, where danger was, still there I met him;</LINE>
<LINE>And like rich hangings in a homely house,</LINE>
<LINE>So was his will in his old feeble body.</LINE>
<LINE>But, noble as he is, look where he comes.</LINE>

<LINE>By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:</LINE>
<LINE>God knows how long it is I have to live;</LINE>
<LINE>And it hath pleased him that three times to-day</LINE>
<LINE>You have defended me from imminent death.</LINE>
<LINE>Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:</LINE>
<LINE>'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,</LINE>
<LINE>Being opposites of such repairing nature.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>

<LINE>I know our safety is to follow them;</LINE>
